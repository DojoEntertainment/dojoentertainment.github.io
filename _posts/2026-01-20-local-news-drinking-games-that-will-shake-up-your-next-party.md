Staying updated with local news is usually a solo sport—scrolling headlines or catching snippets while sipping your morning coffee. But what if you could turn those wild headlines, viral moments, and unexpected updates into the ultimate party drinking game? Welcome to the Drinking Dojo, where we transform the most buzzworthy news into unforgettable party drinking games, dare challenges, and meme-worthy moments.

Ready to make your next house party, pregame, or wedding rager legendary? Here’s how to put a local spin on your drinking games and turn trending headlines into hilarious memories.

### What You Need

- A TV, laptop, or phone to stream the news (local channels, news sites, or even social media feeds)
- Your drink of choice (go wild, but stay safe)
- Drinking Dojo dare cards or use our [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) to create your own news-inspired deck
- At least 3 friends (but the more, the messier)

### How to Play Local News Drinking Games

**Step 1: Tune In**  
Pick a local news broadcast or scroll through regional trending stories from the US, UK, Canada, Australia, or Denmark. Bonus points for finding the oddest headlines.

**Step 2: Set the Rules**  
Before you start, decide which news cues trigger drinks, dares, or meme challenges. Here are some crowd-favorite rules to get the party started:

- **Drink every time:**  
  - A politician dodges a question  
  - A reporter says “breaking news”  
  - There’s a weather warning  
  - Someone mentions a local celebrity  
  - A classic “and now to sports” transition

- **Dare challenge every time:**  
  - A funny or weird animal story comes up  
  - The anchor stumbles over their words  
  - A viral meme is referenced  
  - There’s a live on-the-scene report

**Step 3: Dare It Up**  
Bring out the wild side with dares from your custom deck or Drinking Dojo’s NSFW dares for adults (if your crew is up for it). Example dares:

- Impersonate the anchor until someone guesses the story  
- Make up your own headline and get the group to react  
- Take a selfie with your best “breaking news” face and post it (or just share it with your group chat)

**Step 4: Meme It**  
If a meme-worthy clip pops up, everyone has to react with their best meme in real life. The most creative gets to nominate someone for a double dare.

**Step 5: Keep Score (or Don’t)**  
Play for bragging rights, assign “news anchors” for each round, or just keep it wild and unfiltered—your party, your rules.

### Local News Drinking Game Variations

- **Election Day Drinking Game:**  
  Perfect for those wild election nights—assign drinks to buzzwords, candidate name drops, or awkward debate moments.

- **Inauguration Day Drinking Game:**  
  Cheers to every ceremonial cliché, special guest appearance, or meme-worthy flub.

- **Couples Drinking Games:**  
  Compete as teams—whichever couple guesses the next news story gets to assign drinks or dares.

- **House Party Ideas:**  
  Pair the local news drinking game with viral drinking games and meme drinking games for a full night of chaos.

### Pro Tips from the Dojo

- Set limits and hydrate—no one wants their wild night to end early.  
- Rotate who picks the news source so everyone’s region gets a spotlight.
