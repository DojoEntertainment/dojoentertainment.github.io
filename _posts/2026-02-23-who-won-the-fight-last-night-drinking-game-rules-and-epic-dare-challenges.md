Last night’s fight was wild—Twitter is still arguing about who actually won.

Welcome to the ultimate “Who Won The Fight Last Night” drinking game, where viral drinking games meet the chaos of meme drinking games, and every round is a new dare challenge.

## What You’ll Need

- A TV or laptop to replay fight highlights or scroll through social media reactions  
- Drinks of choice (beer, seltzers, cocktails, whatever your dojo desires)  
- Dare cards or your phone for quick dare challenges  
- The custom drinking game builder at [Drinking Dojo](https://drinkingdojo.com) (trust us, it’s a game changer)

## How to Play The Who Won The Fight Last Night Drinking Game

**This isn’t your average viral drinking game.** You’ll mix classic rules with meme-worthy dares as you relive the best (and worst) moments of the fight. Here’s the breakdown:

### Step 1: Choose Your Fighter

- Split into two teams: Team Red Corner and Team Blue Corner.
- Pick a side based on who you think won the fight last night. If your group can’t decide, flip a coin or draw straws (more chaos, more fun).

### Step 2: Set the Scene

- Queue up the fight highlights or the best memes from the night.
- Each team grabs their drinks and dare cards.

### Step 3: Play By These Rules

#### Drink When:

- The commentators argue about who’s winning.
- Someone in the group says, “No way, that was a knockout!”
- A meme about the fight pops up in your group chat.
- The ref makes a questionable call.
- A celebrity tweets about the fight.

#### Dare Challenges:

- Every time someone changes their mind about who won, they pull a dare card.
- The losing team at the end of each round must complete a wild NSFW dare (keep it safe and consensual, dojo rules!).
- If there’s a split decision, both teams take a shot and post a meme in the group chat.

### Step 4: Keep Score and Crown a Winner

- After each round of highlights or memes, vote on who had the wildest reaction, best meme, or spiciest dare.
- The team with the most points at the end gets bragging rights and can create their own custom dare for the losers using the Drinking Dojo custom drinking game builder.
