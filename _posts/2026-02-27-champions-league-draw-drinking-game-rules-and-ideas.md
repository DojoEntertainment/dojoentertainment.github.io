If you and your crew are hyped for the next Champions League draw, why not crank up the excitement with a round of party drinking games? At Drinking Dojo, we believe every event deserves a twist—and nothing brings people together like a custom drinking game builder, a few dare challenges, and a healthy dose of meme drinking games. Whether you're hosting a house party or just streaming with friends, this Champions League draw drinking game will turn even the tensest group stage picks into unforgettable memories.

## What You Need for Your Champions League Draw Drinking Game

- A screen to watch the Champions League draw (TV, laptop, or phone)
- Your favorite drinks (beer, cocktails, non-alcoholic options—it’s all good)
- Dare cards or a list of NSFW dares (optional, for the wild ones)
- Scorecards or Drinking Dojo’s [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) for personalized challenges

## How To Play the Champions League Draw Drinking Game

### 1. **Set Up Your Squad**
Gather everyone around the screen, divide into teams based on favorite clubs or countries, or just vibe as one big group. The more the merrier.

### 2. **Pick Your Poison**
Choose your go-to drinks and decide how strong you want the game to be. (Safety tip: know your limits!)

### 3. **Game Rules**

Every time one of these events happens during the Champions League draw, follow the matching drinking challenge:

- **Your Team Is Drawn:** Take a big sip. If your team gets stuck in the “Group of Death,” finish your drink.
- **Rival Teams Face Off:** Everyone supporting those teams does a dare challenge or takes two sips.
- **Host Drops a Meme or Awkward Joke:** Everyone laughs, then the last one to stop drinks.
- **Unexpected Team Advances:** Everyone does a group cheers and drinks.
- **Draw Goes Into Overtime or Gets Awkwardly Delayed:** Start a quickfire round of meme drinking games or dares (customize using our drinking game builder).
- **Panelist Predicts a Wild Upset:** Whoever disagrees with the prediction drinks.

**Bonus:** Use NSFW dares for those who want to spice things up, or add viral drinking games themes—like “Fortnite drinking game” rules, where each draw is a loot box.

## Pro Tips for Epic Champions League Draw Drinking Games

- **Mix Up Dare Challenges:** Throw in wedding party games or couples drinking games for a wild twist if your group has a mix of relationships.
- **Keep Score:** If you’re competitive, track who ends up drinking the most and crown them the “Championship Chugger.”
- **Add Memes:** Have everyone bring a meme to the party. If your meme goes viral in the group chat, hand out a dare!
