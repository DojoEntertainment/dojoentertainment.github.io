## What You’ll Need

- Your beverage of choice (no judgment zone—beer, seltzers, cocktails, or mocktails)  
- A screen to stream the Australia Women vs India Women match  
- Dare challenges or meme drinking games cards (pro tip: check out our [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) to spice things up)  
- Shot glasses or cups for each player  
- Optional: NSFW dares for those who want to turn the heat up  

## How To Play

Set up is easy. Get your squad together (virtual or in-person works!), fire up the match, and follow these party drinking games rules. The goal? Make every run, wicket, and wild play an excuse for unforgettable drinking challenges.

### Basic Rules

**Take a sip when:**  
- A boundary (four or six) is hit  
- The commentators mention a viral moment or meme  
- A player celebrates a milestone (fifty, century, or wicket haul)  
- There’s an umpire review  

**Take a shot when:**  
- A player gets out for a duck  
- There’s a dropped catch  
- The camera catches someone in the crowd with a wild sign or costume  

**Dare challenges when:**  
- The third umpire decision takes longer than a minute (draw a dare card or use the custom drinking game builder for a meme drinking game dare)  
- There’s a rain delay (everyone must do a quick NSFW dare or share their best meme in the group chat)  
- The team you’re supporting loses a wicket unexpectedly (make up a new rule for the next 10 minutes—house party ideas, anyone?)  

### Bonus Drinking Challenges

- **Fortnite drinking game twist:** Every time a player “emotes” after a big play, the last person to mimic the dance takes a drink.  
- **Election day drinking game vibes:** When the score changes dramatically, everyone votes on who’s the MVP so far—losers drink!  

## Keep It Safe, Keep It Fun

Remember, the point is to have fun and make memories, not to go overboard. Hydrate, pace yourself, and look after your mates—whether you’re watching in Australia, the UK, Canada, Denmark, or anywhere in between.
