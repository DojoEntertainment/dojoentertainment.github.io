The US Open Tennis 2025 is almost here, which means it’s time to rally your crew, chill your drinks, and bring the party to the court—right from your living room. At Drinking Dojo, we believe every match point is an opportunity for wild dares, viral drinking games, and unforgettable memories. Whether you're a die-hard tennis fan or just love any excuse for a house party, these tennis-inspired party drinking games will keep everyone on their toes (and maybe a little wobbly on their feet).

## The Ultimate US Open Tennis 2025 Drinking Game

Ready to serve up some fun? Here’s how you can turn every match into a drinking challenge worthy of a grand slam.

### What You’ll Need

- Your favorite drinks (beer, seltzers, cocktails—dealer’s choice)
- TV or stream for the US Open Tennis 2025 matches
- Dare cards or a custom drinking game builder (try our [custom tools](https://drinkingdojo.com)!)
- Tennis-themed props (optional, but 10/10 for vibes)
- Friends who can handle their serves and shots

### The Basic Rules

Follow these rules for each match, and remember: the only thing stricter than the umpire’s calls are the dares you’re about to face.

#### Take a Sip When:
- The commentator says “unforced error”
- A player challenges a call
- The camera shows a celebrity in the crowd
- There’s a slow-motion replay

#### Take Two Sips If:
- A player smashes their racket
- The match goes to a tiebreak
- The ball kid makes an epic catch (bonus: cheer for them!)
- There’s a rain delay

#### Finish Your Drink If:
- Someone wins in straight sets
- A match point is overturned by a challenge
- The underdog wins the match

#### Dare Challenge Cards
Spice up your party drinking games with dare challenges between sets. Here are some tennis-worthy NSFW dares and meme drinking games to keep the energy high:

- **Serve and Strip:** Miss your prediction? Remove an accessory or piece of clothing.
- **Match Point Meme:** Create a meme using a screenshot from the match. Loser drinks!
- **Fortnite Celebration:** Winner of a rally gets to choose someone to do their best Fortnite dance—or down a shot.
