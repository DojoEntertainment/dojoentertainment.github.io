In the realm of social games, few have captured the collective imagination quite like Wordle. This deceptively simple word puzzle has taken the internet by storm, challenging players to guess a five-letter word within six attempts. But what if we could add a fun twist to this popular trend? Enter "Wordle Whirl," a delightful drinking game that blends the excitement of Wordle with a touch of social spirit.

### What is Wordle Whirl?

Wordle Whirl is a lively drinking game inspired by the viral word puzzle game, Wordle. It's perfect for gatherings with friends, bringing together the thrill of word guessing with the playful nature of a drinking game. To enjoy Wordle Whirl, all you need is a device to play Wordle on, a group of friends, and your favorite beverages.

### How to Play Wordle Whirl

#### Materials Needed

- A device with internet access to play [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/)
- Drinks of your choice
- A group of friends (ideally 3-6 players)

#### Game Rules

1. **Set Up the Game:**
   - Start by opening the Wordle game on your device. Make sure everyone can see the screen.
   
2. **Decide on the Drinking Cues:**
   - Before the game begins, agree on specific cues that will prompt players to take a sip. Here are some suggestions:
     - **Incorrect Guess:** Everyone takes a sip each time an incorrect letter is guessed.
     - **Correct Letter, Wrong Position:** The guesser takes a sip for each letter that is in the wrong position but is correct.
     - **Correct Position:** The guesser nominates someone else to take a sip for each letter correctly positioned.
   
3. **Playing the Game:**
   - A player begins by guessing a five-letter word. They enter the word into Wordle and submit it.
   - Based on the feedback from Wordle (correct or incorrect letters/positions), the drinking cues determine who takes a sip.
   - Continue taking turns guessing words until the correct word is found, or all six attempts are used.
   
4. **Celebrate or Commemorate:**
   - If a player successfully guesses the Wordle word, they can choose someone to finish their drink. If the word is not guessed within six attempts, everyone finishes their drink.

5. **Repeat:**
   - Start a new round with a different player guessing first, and continue the fun!

### Tips for a Great Game Night

- **Pace Yourself:** Remember, the goal is to have fun, so drink responsibly and at your own pace.
- **Mix It Up:** Feel free to modify the drinking cues to suit your group's preferences.
- **Stay Safe:** Ensure everyone has a safe way to get home if youâ€™re playing away from home.
