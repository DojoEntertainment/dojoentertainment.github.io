### How to Play "Wordle Hint Today"

#### Objective

The goal is simple: guess the Wordle word of the day with the help of hints, while also enjoying some drinks. The game is best played with a group of friends, and it’s a fantastic way to combine brainpower with a little bit of buzz.

#### Materials Needed

- A device with internet access
- A selection of your favorite drinks
- Wordle Puzzle (You can play Wordle freely online)
- A notepad for keeping score

#### Game Setup

1. **Choose a Wordle Master**: Designate one person to be the Wordle Master. This person will look up the Wordle word of the day and provide hints to the other players. They can find the word by searching for "wordle hint today" to ensure everyone is guessing the same word.

2. **Set Up the Game Area**: Arrange your seating so everyone can see the Wordle Master and their hints. Make sure drinks are easily accessible.

3. **Prepare the Drinks**: Each player should have their drink of choice ready. Remember to drink responsibly!

#### Rules of the Game

1. **Round One - The First Hint**: The Wordle Master gives the group a broad hint about the word, such as "This word is related to weather". Each player gets one guess after the hint. Players who guess incorrectly take one sip of their drink.

2. **Round Two - Narrowing Down**: The Wordle Master provides a more specific hint, like "This word is often associated with rain". Players guess again, and those who are wrong take two sips.

3. **Round Three - Almost There**: The Wordle Master gives a hint that reveals a letter in the correct position, such as "The fourth letter is an N". Players guess once more, and incorrect guesses result in three sips.

4. **Final Guess**: If no one has guessed the word correctly yet, the Wordle Master gives a final hint, such as the length of the word. Players make one last guess, with incorrect guesses requiring a celebratory finishing sip.

5. **Bonus Round**: If someone guesses the word correctly at any stage, they become the next Wordle Master for a new game, and everyone else takes a celebratory sip.

#### Winning the Game

The game can continue for as many rounds as you like or until everyone’s vocabulary (or beverages) run dry. The true winner is the one who becomes the Wordle Master the most times or simply everyone for having a great time together!

### Conclusion

The "Wordle Hint Today" drinking game is a perfect blend of challenge, laughter, and social interaction.
