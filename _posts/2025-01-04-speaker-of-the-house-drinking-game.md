title: Speaker of the House Drinking Game
---


In the political theater of government, few events are as unpredictable and entertaining as the Speaker of the House vote. The drama, the suspense, the backdoor deals - it's all there. Why not bring some of that excitement to your living room with a drinking game inspired by this democratic spectacle? Gather your friends, pour your favorite beverages, and get ready to debate who will be the next Speaker of the House!

### Materials Needed

- A group of friends or family
- Your favorite drinks
- A deck of cards
- A TV or device to stream the latest political session or news coverage

### How to Play

Gather your political party - I mean, your friends - and follow these rules to ensure a night of spirited fun

1. **Pick Your Politician**  
   Before the game starts, everyone must choose a politician participating in the vote. You will be tied to this politician for the duration of the game.

2. **Card Draw**  
   Shuffle the deck of cards and lay it face down in the center. Each player takes turns drawing a card. The card you draw determines your action

      - **Ace** - Finish your drink. Just like in politics sometimes you need to take one for the team.
      - **King** - Make a rule. The last person to be elected Speaker gets to make a rule everyone must follow.
      - **Queen** - Question time. Ask another player a political trivia question. If they get it wrong they drink.
      - **Jack** - Jargon jargon jargon. Use political jargon in a sentence. If you fail to make sense drink.
      - **Number Cards** - Take that number of sips. For example draw a 4 and take 4 sips.

3. **Key Moments**  
   If you're watching a live stream or coverage, take a sip every time one of these moments occurs

   - A politician changes their vote
   - A dramatic pause or long-winded speech
   - Someone uses the phrase "bipartisan support"
   - A tie-breaking vote is cast

4. **The Speaker is Chosen**  
   Once the Speaker of the House is officially chosen, everyone must finish their drinks in a toast to democracy, and the game comes to an end.

### Extra Tips

- **Designate a Moderator**: Much like a debate needs a mediator, assign one person to keep track of the rules and make sure everyone is following them.
  
- **Stay Informed**: Use this opportunity to learn more about the political process and its players. Itâ€™s a fun way to mix education with entertainment.

- **Play Responsibly**: Remember, the goal is to have fun. Make sure everyone is drinking responsibly and knows their limits.
