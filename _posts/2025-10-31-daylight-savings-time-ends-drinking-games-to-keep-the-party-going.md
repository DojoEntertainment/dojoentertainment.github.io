When you gain that extra hour, there’s only one thing to do: make it legendary. Whether you’re in the US, UK, Canada, Australia, or Denmark, when the clocks roll back, it's prime time for wild party drinking games, viral dares, and meme-worthy mayhem. At Drinking Dojo, we know how to turn every minute into an unforgettable drinking challenge, and this is the ultimate excuse.

Ready to turn back time—in style? Here are the best drinking games and dare challenges to make the most of that bonus hour.

## The Extra Hour Power Hour Drinking Game

**Materials Needed:**  
- Your favorite drinks  
- Shot glasses  
- A timer or playlist

**How to Play:**  
1. Set your timer for 60 minutes (or use a 60-song playlist with one-minute tracks).  
2. Every minute, everyone takes a shot of their drink (it’s called “Power Hour” for a reason).  
3. For extra fun, throw in a custom dare challenge every 10 minutes—think viral drinking games with a wild twist.  
4. Last one standing wins the title of Time Lord (and maybe a round of applause).

**Pro Tip:** If you want to up the ante (or go meme drinking game style), swap out shots for sips and add a meme challenge every 15 minutes. Whoever fails the dare drinks double!

## Reverse Time Dare Challenges for Drinking Games

**Materials Needed:**  
- Pen and paper  
- Drinks  
- Dare cards (or use the [Drinking Dojo custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) to create digital ones)

**How to Play:**  
1. Write down NSFW dares, meme-inspired tasks, or house party ideas on slips of paper.  
2. Every time someone looks at a clock or phone, they have to pull a dare card.  
3. If they refuse, they drink. If they do it, everyone else drinks.  
4. Bonus: Include some couples drinking games dares for paired-up partygoers.

**Dare Challenge Ideas:**  
- Reenact your favorite meme in 15 seconds  
- Confess your wildest pregame story  
- Try a Fortnite dance while holding your drink—spill and you chug  
- Make up a wedding party game on the spot

## Fall Back Flip Cup Drinking Challenge

**Materials Needed:**  
- Plastic cups  
- Table  
- Drinks  
- Stopwatch

**How to Play:**  
1. Divide into two teams.  
2. Play classic flip cup, but every time your team loses a round, you have to move your cups backward by one space, not forward.  
3. First team to make it back to the starting line wins.  
4. Throw in bonus dare challenges for the losing team each round for that viral drinking game spice.

## Meme Drinking Game: Clock Blocked

**Materials Needed:**  
- Drinks  
- Printed memes or meme generator  
- Timer

**How to Play:**  
1. Everyone gets a meme at the start of the hour.  
2. If someone references the time or daylight savings, they get “clock blocked” and must share their meme with the group—and finish their drink.  
3. Best meme reaction wins a custom dare challenge for someone else.
