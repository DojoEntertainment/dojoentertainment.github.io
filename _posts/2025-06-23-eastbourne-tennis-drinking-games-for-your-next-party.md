Whether you’re watching courtside from your couch in the US, UK, Canada, Australia, or Denmark, these party drinking games will serve up fun with every set.

Ready to transform your next tennis watch party? Here’s how to play, what you’ll need, and some wild twists to take your Eastbourne tennis night to viral status.

## What You’ll Need

- A screen to stream Eastbourne tennis matches  
- Plenty of drinks (choose your level of chaos: beer, seltzers, cocktails, or mocktails)  
- Friends who are down for anything  
- Printed or digital game rules (bonus points if you use our [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com))  
- Optional: Tennis-themed cups, paddles, and headbands for extra flair

## How to Play Eastbourne Tennis Drinking Games

### The Basic Rules

1. **Pick Your Players**  
   - Everyone picks a tennis player to “cheer for” during the match. If your player messes up, you drink.  
2. **Serve and Sip**  
   - Every time a player serves an ace, everyone takes a sip.  
3. **Double Fault Dare**  
   - If there’s a double fault, the last person to yell “Double!” must do a dare challenge.  
4. **Rally Roulette**  
   - During any rally that goes 10+ shots, everyone drinks for the duration. Last to finish their drink picks the next dare.  
5. **Changeover Chug**  
   - At every changeover, vote on the wildest meme drinking game rule to add for the next set (think: “no one can say ‘out’ or you drink”).
