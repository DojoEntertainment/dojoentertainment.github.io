### How to Play

The TikTok Ban Drinking Game is designed for groups of three or more players. The more, the merrier! Each round involves a series of prompts inspired by TikTok trends, memes, and user behavior. The goal is simple - follow the rules and avoid taking a sip. Be prepared for a night of nostalgia, laughter, and maybe a little bit of chaos.

### Materials Needed

- A group of friends ready to play
- Your favorite drinks
- A device with internet access to look up TikTok trends if needed
- A comfy space with enough room for everyone

### Game Rules

1. **Set the Scene**  
   Create a playlist of TikTok's greatest hits to get everyone in the mood. Songs that went viral on the app are a great way to set the tone.

2. **TikTok Trivia**  
   Start each round with a trivia question related to TikTok. It could be about popular creators, viral challenges, or infamous bans. The first person to answer correctly chooses someone to drink.

3. **Trend Imitation**  
   Each player takes turns mimicking a popular TikTok trend or dance. If their performance gets a thumbs down from the majority, they must take a drink.

4. **Most Likely To**  
   Play a round of "Most Likely To" with a TikTok twist. For example, "Who is most likely to become TikTok famous?" The player with the most votes drinks. For more ideas, check out [Most Likely To](https://drinkingdojo.com/games/most-likely-to).

5. **Storytime**  
   Share a story about your favorite TikTok moment. It could be a video that made you laugh, cry, or simply scroll endlessly. If your story fails to entertain the group, you take a drink.

6. **Ban Roulette**  
   Each player writes down a TikTok trend on a piece of paper. Mix them up and choose one at random. If you've participated in the trend, take a drink.

7. **Influencer Showdown**  
   Choose a TikTok influencer and impersonate their style, quotes, or signature moves. If the group fails to guess who you are, they drink. If they guess correctly, you drink.

### Safety First

Remember that the TikTok Ban Drinking Game is meant for fun. Always drink responsibly and know your limits. Ensure everyone has a safe way to get home if you're not playing at home.
