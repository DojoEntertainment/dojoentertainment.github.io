Bring the drama and excitement of Love Island USA Casa Amor season 7 straight to your next house party with drinking games that are sure to spark unforgettable memories. Whether you’re throwing a villa-themed pregame, vibing with your besties, or just need wild party drinking games for a Friday night, these Love Island-inspired drinking challenges will have everyone talking (and maybe snogging) until the sun comes up.

## What You’ll Need

- Your favorite drinks (cocktails, mocktails, beer, or whatever makes you feel like an islander)
- A TV or streaming device to watch Love Island USA Casa Amor season 7—live or reruns!
- Friends who are ready to gossip, dare, and maybe get a little savage
- Dare challenge cards, meme drinking games, or Drinking Dojo’s **[custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com)** for the ultimate upgrade

## The Love Island Casa Amor Drinking Game Rules

Get ready for a meme-worthy party drinking game that matches the chaos of Casa Amor. Here’s how you play:

### 1. The Recoupling Sip

Every time an islander decides to “recouple” or get flirty with someone new, everyone takes a sip. If it’s especially savage, double it!

### 2. Dare Challenges: Casa Amor Edition

When a contestant completes a wild dare or challenge on screen, the group picks someone to do a real-life dare from your deck. Want to spice it up? Go for NSFW dares or create your own using Drinking Dojo’s custom drinking game builder.

### 3. Text Alert Chug

Whenever someone gets a text on the show, grab your drink and take a chug. Last person to raise their glass does a bonus dare.

### 4. Meme Drinking Game Moments

Spot a meme-worthy meltdown or iconic one-liner? Everyone shouts it out—the last person to join in drinks. Bonus: Share your favorites on social media and tag your crew.

### 5. Couples Drinking Games Twist

If two people in your group are dating (or just coupled up for the night), assign them a secret word. Anytime the word is said on the show, they both drink. Wedding party games, but make it villa vibes.

## Customize Your Casa Amor Experience

Want to go viral with your own party drinking games? Drinking Dojo’s custom drinking game builder lets you add in Fortnite drinking game rounds, wedding party games, or even inauguration day drinking game rules for the ultimate crossover event. Add your squad’s inside jokes, wildest dares, and favorite meme drinking game moments for a night no one will forget.

## Pro Tips for the Ultimate Islander Party

- **Dress Code:** Swimwear, sunglasses, and cheeky villa vibes totally encouraged
- **Snack Game:** Keep it easy—think chips, pizza, and finger food for minimal cleanup
- **Playlist:** Curate bangers worthy of the Casa Amor dance floor
- **Safety First:** Hydrate, pace yourself, and always know your limits
