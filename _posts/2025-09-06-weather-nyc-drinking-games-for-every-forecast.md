Rain or shine, New York City weather is always a conversation starter. But what if you could turn those unpredictable showers or sunny spells into the ultimate party drinking games? At Drinking Dojo, we’re all about bending the rules and leveling up any gathering. Whether you’re pregaming before a wild night out or chilling in your Brooklyn apartment during a downpour, here’s how to make the most of every forecast with our weather-inspired drinking games.

## Why Weather NYC Drinking Games Are a Vibe

NYC’s weather is legendary for switching up on you—one minute it’s blue skies, the next you’re dodging puddles. That’s exactly why weather-based party drinking games are a must-have for city dwellers and visitors alike. They add a twist to your house party ideas, wedding ragers, or even a casual hang with friends.

## Game 1: The Rain Check Challenge

When the city gets soaked, bring the storm inside.

**Materials:**
- A deck of cards
- Your favorite drinks
- A phone for weather updates

**How to Play:**
1. **Card Draw:** Each player draws a card.  
   - Red card = Take a sip  
   - Black card = Give a sip
2. **Thunder Round:** Every time you hear thunder (or if someone gets a weather alert), everyone must complete a dare challenge.  
   - Use Drinking Dojo’s [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) to create wild, meme drinking games or NSFW dares for extra spice.
3. **Rainfall Rule:** If it’s actually raining outside, double the drinks every 15 minutes.

*Pro Tip:* Pair this with our viral drinking games for a non-stop good time.

## Game 2: The NYC Heatwave Hustle

There’s nothing like a sweaty subway ride to make you thirsty. Turn up the heat indoors, too!

**Materials:**
- Shots or cold beers
- Sunglasses for everyone
- A fan (optional)

**How to Play:**
1. **Sunglasses On:** Anytime someone says it’s “too hot,” everyone wearing sunglasses takes a drink.
2. **Fan Dance:** If anyone fans themselves, they must do a dare challenge chosen by the group.
3. **Weather Update:** If the temperature hits a record high (check your weather app!), everyone finishes their drink.

*Bonus:* Perfect for summer house party ideas or rooftop hangouts in the US, UK, Canada, and beyond.

## Game 3: Snow Day Showdown

Snow in the city? Time for a cozy, meme drinking game session.

**Materials:**
- Hot drinks (spiked cocoa, anyone?)
- Blankets and cozy vibes
- Drinking Dojo dare pack

**How to Play:**
1. **Snow Story:** Each person shares a wild weather story. If you can’t top the last tale, take a drink.
2. **Blanket Rule:** If you’re wrapped in a blanket, you can make someone else do a dare challenge.
3. **Snowfall Sip:** Every time you see a snowplow (or hear a weather warning), everyone drinks.
