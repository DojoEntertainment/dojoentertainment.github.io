## What You’ll Need

- The SNL episode airing tonight (preferably live, but replay works too)
- A group of friends (2+ is perfect, more is better)
- Dare challenges and dares (optional: grab a [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) pack for extra spice)
- Solo cups or shot glasses

## How to Play the SNL Tonight Musical Guest Drinking Game

### Step 1: Set the Stage

Gather everyone around the TV or laptop. Make sure everyone knows who the SNL tonight musical guest is — it’s about to get competitive.

### Step 2: Distribute Drinks

Everyone grabs their drink. Decide if you want this to be a chill night or a wild ride. We won’t judge.

### Step 3: Game Rules

Every time the musical guest does any of the following, take a sip, a gulp, or complete a dare (your choice):

- **Performs a song you already know**  
  *Take one sip*

- **Wears something outrageous**  
  *Everyone cheers and drinks*

- **Makes the audience laugh during a lyric or banter**  
  *Person who laughs first does a dare*

- **Has a surprise guest join during the performance**  
  *Everyone finishes their drink*

- **Gets mentioned by the host or cast outside of the performance**  
  *Last person to shout the guest’s name does a dare*

- **Song goes viral on socials during the show**  
  *First person to spot a trending hashtag picks someone to drink*

### Bonus Dare Challenges

Add a meme twist with these custom dare challenges:

- If the musical guest pulls out a dance move that’s meme-worthy, everyone must copy it — loser takes two sips.
- If the musical guest’s outfit inspires a “what are they wearing” moment, group selfie time. Post it and tag with a meme. The bravest gets to make a custom rule for the next round.
- Watching with your partner? The couple who nails the best lip-sync wins a pass from the next dare.

### Extra Party Drinking Game Ideas
