Ready to turn your next hangout into a night to remember? If you’re looking for a new twist on party drinking games, the Connections June 14 drinking game is about to become your group’s go-to move. This viral drinking game takes inspiration from wordplay challenges and adds a splash of wild dares and meme energy straight from Drinking Dojo. Whether you’re pregaming with your mates, throwing a wedding after-party, or just vibing at home, this game packs in laughs, surprises, and unforgettable connections.

## What Is the Connections June 14 Drinking Game?

Imagine mixing the brain-teasing fun of group word association with the spicy kick of dare challenges and meme drinking games. Connections June 14 is all about spotting links between words, calling out your friends, and facing hilarious dares when you slip up. It’s fast, flexible, and perfect for any crew, from house parties to destination weddings.

## What You’ll Need

- A list of 16 words (write them on cards or a whiteboard)
- Drinks of choice (beer, cocktails, seltzers, whatever fuels your fun)
- Dare cards or a phone to look up NSFW dares (get wild, but keep it safe)
- A timer (your phone works)
- At least 4 players — the more, the merrier

**Optional:** Use the [Drinking Dojo custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) to create your own Connections pack, loaded with inside jokes and meme-worthy dares.

## How to Play Connections June 14

### 1. Set Up Your Words

Pick 16 random words and display them for everyone to see. These can be themed around anything — memes, pop culture, wedding party games, or even Fortnite drinking game terms for the gamers in the group.

### 2. Form Your Teams

Split into two teams. Each team will take turns trying to “connect” the words into four groups of four, based on a common theme or link.

### 3. Take Your Shots

On each turn, a team has one minute to discuss and pick a group of four words they think are connected. If they get it right, the other team drinks! If they get it wrong, they roll the dare dice or draw a dare card and someone on their team has to complete the challenge.

### 4. Dare Challenges

Mix things up by adding NSFW dares or meme drinking game challenges whenever a team messes up. Think “sing your last text message,” “swap an item of clothing,” or “share your wildest house party ideas.”

### 5. Victory Lap

The first team to correctly group all 16 words wins — and gets to hand out a round of drinks or make up a new dare for the losers.
