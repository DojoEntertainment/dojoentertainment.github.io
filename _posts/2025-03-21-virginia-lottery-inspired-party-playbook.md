### Introduction

Inspired by the excitement of the "Virginia Lottery," we've crafted a unique and engaging game that combines the thrill of chance with the joy of social drinking. Whether you're hosting a casual get-together or a lively party, this game promises endless entertainment and laughter. So gather your friends, grab your drinks, and let's play the "Virginia Lottery Drinking Game"!

### Materials Needed

To get started, you'll need:

- A deck of cards
- A set of six-sided dice
- A variety of drinks (alcoholic or non-alcoholic)
- A large bowl or container
- Shot glasses
- Paper and pen

### Game Setup

1. **Create a Pot:** Place the bowl in the center of your table. This will be the "lottery pot."
2. **Deck Preparation:** Remove all face cards (Kings, Queens, Jacks) from the deck. You'll only need numbered cards (Ace through 10).
3. **Player Setup:** Each player should have a shot glass and their drink of choice nearby.

### How to Play

1. **Draw and Roll:** Each player draws a card from the deck and rolls the dice in turn.
   
2. **Match Your Luck:** 
   - If the number on the card matches the number rolled on the dice, the player wins and can choose another player to take a shot.
   - If the numbers do not match, the player must add a predetermined amount of their drink to the "lottery pot."

3. **Bonus Round:** 
   - Each time a player rolls a double (two of the same number on both dice), they get to draw two cards. If either card matches the dice, they win and can assign two shots.

4. **Lottery Pot Draw:** 
   - Once the deck is exhausted, it's time for the lottery draw. Shuffle all cards back into the deck.
   - Each player draws one card. The player with the highest card must drink the contents of the lottery pot.

5. **Repeat:** Shuffle the deck and start again! The game continues until you've had your fill of fun or drinks.

### Tips for a Great Experience

- **Stay Hydrated:** Ensure there's plenty of water available to keep everyone hydrated.
- **Set Limits:** Know your limits and play responsibly. The goal is to have fun, not overindulge.
- **Non-Alcoholic Option:** For those who prefer not to drink alcohol, use non-alcoholic beverages so everyone can participate.
