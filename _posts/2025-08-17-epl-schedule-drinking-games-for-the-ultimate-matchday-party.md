Ready to turn your next Premier League match into a legendary party? If you’re all about wild dares, viral drinking games, and making every goal unforgettable, you’re in the right place. Whether you’re vibing with friends in London, Toronto, Sydney, Copenhagen, or New York, the EPL schedule is basically your new game night lineup. Let’s break down how to take every match from kickoff to last call—with the Drinking Dojo twist.

## Why EPL Schedule Drinking Games Are a Must

The EPL schedule drops fresh fixtures every week, and that’s your golden ticket for party drinking games. From fierce rivalries to last-minute goals, the drama is perfect for custom drinking game builder magic. Who says you need an excuse to gather the squad, grab your favorite drinks, and add some NSFW dares or meme drinking games to the mix?

## What You’ll Need

- Your go-to drinks (lager, cocktails, shots—dealer’s choice)
- A TV or streaming device for the match
- The EPL schedule (so you know when to start)
- Drinking Dojo’s custom drinking game builder for extra spice
- Dare cards or a phone for meme dares
- Good vibes and your crew

## How To Play EPL Schedule Drinking Games

### Step 1: Pick Your Match

Check the latest EPL schedule, pick a match, and invite your friends. Bonus points for picking a rivalry game or one with stakes—more drama, more fun.

### Step 2: Set The Rules

Classic party drinking games are great, but EPL matches call for custom rules. Here’s a Drinking Dojo-approved starter pack:

#### Basic Rules

- **Goal Gulp:** Every time your team scores, everyone else takes a shot.
- **Yellow Card Sip:** Whenever a yellow card is shown, everyone sips. If it’s your favorite player, take two.
- **Red Card Dare:** The person supporting the player’s team must complete a dare challenge (find some wild ones in our custom drinking game builder).
- **Commentator Cliché:** When you hear phrases like “end-to-end stuff” or “park the bus,” everyone drinks.
- **VAR Chaos:** If VAR interrupts play, last person to shout “VAR!” does an NSFW dare.

#### Meme Drinking Games & Dare Challenges

- **Fortnite Celebration:** If a player does a Fortnite-style goal celebration, everyone must dance or finish their drink.
- **Wedding Party Games Twist:** Watching with couples? Each time a player kisses the badge, couples must swap drinks.
- **Election Day Twist:** If a political ad interrupts the match (shoutout to our US and UK fans), everyone votes on who does the next dare.
