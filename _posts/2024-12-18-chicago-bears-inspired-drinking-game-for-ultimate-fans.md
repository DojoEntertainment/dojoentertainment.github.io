- A TV to watch the Bears game
- Snacks to keep everyone fueled
- Optional Chicago Bears gear to enhance the spirit

## How to Play

This drinking game is based on the live actions of the Chicago Bears during a game. The game continues for the entirety of the football match.

### Rules

1. **Touchdown Toast**: Whenever the Bears score a touchdown, everyone raises their glasses and takes a celebratory drink. Cheers to the Bears!

2. **Field Goal Sip**: When the Bears make a successful field goal, take a modest sip from your drink. Practice moderation - there could be a few of these!

3. **Interception Chug**: If the Bears' defense intercepts the ball, it's time to chug your drink. Show your appreciation for a stellar defensive play.

4. **Flag on the Play**: Every time a penalty flag is thrown against the Bears, take a drink. This includes false starts, holding, and any other infractions.

5. **Bear Down Chant**: Whenever the Bears' fight song or chant is played or heard, stand up and take a drink while singing or chanting along. Show your team spirit!

6. **Quarterback Sack Sip**: If the Bears' quarterback gets sacked, take a sip to commiserate. It's tough being the QB.

7. **Halftime Shot**: At halftime, gather everyone for a halftime shot. Use this time to discuss the first half and make predictions for the second.

8. **Victory Celebration**: If the Bears win the game, celebrate by finishing your drink. If they lose, finish your drink in solidarity - there's always next week!

### Optional Bonus Rule

- **The Trubisky Tribute**: Choose a player from the opposing team (perhaps an ex-Bears player) and every time they make a notable play, take a drink. It's a fun way to remember past players and their impact on the Bears.

This game is designed to enhance your game day experience and make watching the Chicago Bears with friends even more entertaining. Remember to drink responsibly and ensure that everyone has a safe way to get home after the game.
