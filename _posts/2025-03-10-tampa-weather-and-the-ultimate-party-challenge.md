In the heart of Florida, where the sun often plays hide and seek with clouds, Tampa weather is a subject of daily conversation. What better way to embrace the unpredictability than with a game that celebrates it? Welcome to the "Tampa Weather Challenge," a fun and engaging way to turn your next gathering into an unforgettable experience. Whether you're a local or just visiting, this game will help you make the most of Tampa’s ever-changing skies while enjoying a refreshing drink with friends.

### Materials Needed

- A group of friends (4-10 players recommended)
- A smartphone or tablet with a weather app or access to a weather website
- A variety of drinks (alcoholic or non-alcoholic, depending on your preference)
- A timer or stopwatch

### How to Play

1. **Set Up**: Gather everyone in a comfortable space with a good view of the sky. Make sure everyone has access to a drink of their choice.

2. **Weather Check**: Open a weather app or website and enter "Tampa weather" to get the latest forecast and current conditions. Bookmark this page for easy access throughout the game.

3. **Game Rules**:

   - **Sunny Surprise**: If the weather is sunny when you start, everyone takes a sip to celebrate the sunshine. If it stays sunny for over 30 minutes, take another sip.
   
   - **Cloudy Countdown**: If clouds begin to cover the skies, start a timer. If it stays cloudy for more than 15 minutes, everyone takes a drink.
   
   - **Rainy Refill**: When raindrops start falling, it’s time for a refill. Finish your current drink and get ready for the next round.
   
   - **Thunderstorm Toast**: If a thunderstorm is predicted, pause the game for a special toast. Raise your glasses and take a hearty drink to the roaring skies.
   
   - **Temperature Twist**: Check the temperature every 20 minutes. If it changes by more than 5 degrees in either direction, everyone takes two sips.

4. **Winning the Game**: The game is more about enjoying each other's company and the weather than winning. However, if you want to declare a winner, the person who predicts the next weather change correctly earns the title of "Tampa Weather Champion" and can choose a new rule for the next game.

### Safety First

Remember, the "Tampa Weather Challenge" is all about fun and laughter. Always keep the drinking responsible, and if alcohol is involved, ensure everyone has a safe way to get home. Consider playing with non-alcoholic drinks for a family-friendly version.
