Ready to take your next party from basic to legendary? Meet the IG Drinking Game—the viral drinking game that’s lighting up group chats and turning every scroll into a wild dare. Whether you’re pregaming before a night out, chilling with roommates, or spicing up a wedding afterparty, this party drinking game guarantees laughs, dares, and a bit of friendly chaos.

## What Is the IG Drinking Game?

The IG Drinking Game is all about bringing the fun (and sometimes cringe) of Instagram to your living room. It’s a mashup of meme drinking games, dare challenges, and social sleuthing. Perfect for house parties, couples nights, or even destination weddings, this game gets everyone involved—no filter needed.

## What You Need

- Your phone (with Instagram)
- Drinks of choice (mocktails or cocktails, your call)
- A group of at least 3 people (the more, the messier)
- A list of creative dares or access to [Drinking Dojo’s custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) for bonus challenge ideas

## How To Play

1. **Set Up**
   - Everyone grabs a drink and opens their Instagram.
   - Decide if you want to play with posts, stories, reels, or DMs—or mix it up!

2. **Spin the Bottle or Pick a Player**
   - Old school: Spin a bottle to choose who goes first.
   - Techie: Use a randomizer app.

3. **Choose a Challenge**
   - The group picks a challenge from the list below (or create your own with the custom drinking game builder). The chosen player has to complete it or drink.

4. **Complete the Challenge or Drink**
   - If the player completes the challenge, they pick the next victim.
   - If they refuse, they take a dare or a drink (or both, if you’re feeling savage).

5. **Keep It Going**
   - First player to tap out does an NSFW dare (if you’re brave) or finishes their drink.

## Top IG Drinking Game Challenges

- **Like Your Ex’s Last Three Photos:** Complete it or take two drinks.
- **Post an Embarrassing Story:** Let the group write the caption. Refuse? Take a dare.
- **DM a Celebrity:** Bonus points if you get a reply. No guts? Down your drink.
- **Recreate a Viral Meme:** Post it to your story or take a shot.
- **Unfollow and Re-follow the Bride or Groom (Wedding Party Version):** If they notice and message, everyone else drinks.
- **Screenshot Your Explore Page:** If it’s memes, you’re safe. If it’s NSFW, take a double dare.

## Tips For Next-Level Fun
