Ready to turn MLK Day into a legendary house party? Whether you're chilling with mates, hosting a wild pregame, or just vibing on a long weekend, nothing says unforgettable like a round (or five) of drinking games. At Drinking Dojo, we’re all about bending the rules, upping the dares, and making every sip count. So, let’s get into some epic party drinking games and dare challenges that’ll make your MLK Day the stuff of group chat legends.

## Why Drinking Games Are a Must for MLK Day

MLK Day often means a day off, and that’s the perfect excuse to gather your crew for some classic and viral drinking games. From meme drinking games to custom drinking game builders, there’s a game for every vibe—rowdy, chill, or anything in between.

## The Ultimate MLK Day Drinking Game

Looking for something fresh? Here’s a custom game that mixes dares, memes, and a little MLK Day trivia—because why not add a dash of friendly competition to the mix?

### What You’ll Need

- Drinks of choice (cocktails, beer, or mocktails for the sober warriors)  
- A deck of cards  
- Sticky notes or paper  
- Markers  
- A phone or speaker for music  
- An internet connection (for quick trivia lookups and meme sharing!)

### How To Play

#### **Setup**

1. **Dare Cards:** On sticky notes, write down wild dares—think classic NSFW dares, meme-inspired antics, or viral TikTok challenges.  
2. **Trivia Cards:** Mix in some MLK Day trivia questions (keep it respectful and fun!).  
3. **Card Deck:** Shuffle your dare and trivia cards together into one epic deck.

#### **Game Rules**

- **Draw & Drink:** Players take turns drawing cards. If you draw a dare, you must complete it or take a drink. If you draw a trivia question and answer wrong, bottoms up!  
- **Meme Challenge:** Every time someone laughs at a meme shared in the group chat or on the TV, they drink.  
- **Double Down:** If you refuse a dare, you have to make up a new one for the next person AND drink twice.  
- **Music Mayhem:** When the playlist drops a throwback or MLK Day-themed tune, everyone drinks.

## Party Add-Ons

Want to take things up a notch? Try these crowd-pleasers:

- **Couples drinking games:** Pair up and face off in trivia or dare duels. Last couple standing gets bragging rights.  
- **Wedding party games:** Got a wedding rager planned on MLK Day weekend? Add in some signature dares to the mix.  
- **House party ideas:** Set up a custom drinking game builder with inside jokes, local memes, or favorite TikToks.

## Pro Tips for the Best MLK Day Bash
