Ready to add some next-level chaos to your house party or pregame? Meet 6abc—the party drinking game that’s blowing up for a reason. Whether you’re vibing with mates in Sydney, hitting a flat in London, or hosting a wedding rager in Toronto, 6abc brings the dares, laughs, and wild energy you crave. If you’re searching for viral drinking games, NSFW dares, or just new house party ideas, this one’s about to become your new go-to.

## What is 6abc?

6abc is a drinking game that mashes together quick thinking, classic dare challenges, and meme drinking game vibes. It’s perfect for groups who want a drinking challenge that’s simple to set up but never boring. All you need are drinks, a table, and your wildest friends.

## What You’ll Need

- Drinks (beer, cocktails, or your favorite bevs)
- A table or flat surface
- A deck of cards (optional for some custom twists)
- Your crew (the more, the merrier—3+ players is ideal)

## How to Play 6abc

### Set Up

1. **Everyone grabs a drink** and sits (or stands, if you’re feeling rowdy) around the table.
2. **Nominate a dealer** for the first round—they’ll keep things moving and explain the rules.
3. If you want to spice things up, you can use the [Drinking Dojo custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) to add meme cards, NSFW dares, or make it a couples drinking game.

### The Rules

Here’s where the magic happens:

1. **The dealer thinks of a six-letter word.** Example: “MEMEAB.”
2. **Starting clockwise, the first player must come up with a word or phrase starting with the first letter (“M”),** then take a sip. Next, the second player does the same with the next letter (“E”), and so on.
   - For example: “Mojito” (player one), “Elephant” (player two), “Martini” (player three), “Eclipse” (player four), “Avocado” (player five), “Banana” (player six).
3. **No repeats!** If someone repeats a word that’s already been used in the round or hesitates for more than 5 seconds, they must complete a dare challenge (dealer’s choice from the Drinking Dojo dare pack) and take an extra drink.
4. **When all six letters are used, the dealer picks a new word** and the next round starts. Want to make it wild? Make the words NSFW or themed for the occasion—like “BRIDAL” at a wedding, or “COUPLE” for a couples drinking game.

### Make It Viral

- **Custom Themes:** Use trending topics (“FORTNITE” for a Fortnite drinking game, “VOTEUSA” for an election day drinking game, or “PARTYUK” for a UK house party).
- **Dare Twist:** Add a dare for every wrong answer or hesitation—go wild with NSFW dares for late-night vibes.
- **Speed Rounds:** Set a timer for each word. If the group completes it in under 30 seconds, everyone else takes a drink except the dealer.

## Why 6abc Rules the Party Scene

- **Easy to learn, impossible to forget.** No complicated setup, just endless hilarious moments.
- **Perfect for any occasion.** From house parties to destination weddings, 6abc adapts—just change the words to fit your vibe.
- **Bring on the memes.** Make the game about viral TikTok trends, memes, or inside jokes for extra chaos.
