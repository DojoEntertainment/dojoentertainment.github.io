## How to Play

This game is perfect for any NFL game. The rules are simple and can be adapted based on the teams playing or the stakes of the game. Here’s how you can play

### Basic Rules

1. **Pre-Game Cheers**: Before the game starts, everyone raises their glass for a collective cheer. Drink to the best team win.

2. **Kickoff Toast**: Once the game kicks off, take a sip to celebrate the start of the action.

3. **Touchdown Toast**: Whenever a team scores a touchdown, everyone takes two sips. If it's your team, add a victory dance.

4. **Field Goal Sip**: When a field goal is scored, take a single sip. If the field goal is missed, take two sips for the missed opportunity.

5. **Turnover Gulp**: If there’s a turnover (interception or fumble), take a gulp to commiserate the blunder.

6. **Commercial Break**: During commercial breaks, each person predicts the next type of commercial (car, beer, insurance, etc.). If you’re wrong, take a sip.

7. **Challenge Chug**: If a coach challenges a play, everyone must start sipping their drink. Stop when the play is confirmed or overturned.

8. **Flag on the Play**: Whenever there’s a penalty flag, take a sip. If it’s against your team, make it a double.

9. **Overtime Overload**: If the game goes into overtime, finish your drink and prepare for sudden death excitement.

### Bonus Rule

- **MVP Guess**: At halftime, everyone guesses who will be the game’s MVP. The person whose guess is closest doesn’t have to drink at the end of the game.

## Tips for Safe and Fun Play

- Remember to drink responsibly and know your limits. It’s all about having fun and enjoying the game.
- Have plenty of water and snacks on hand to keep the energy up and everyone hydrated.
- Designate a driver or arrange for a safe ride home if you’re playing away from home.
