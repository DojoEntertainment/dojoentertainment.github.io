Ready to turn a regular night into an epic memory? Whether you’re in a dorm room, prepping for a wedding afterparty, or just want to spice up your next hangout, the ultimate party drinking games are here to keep the good times rolling. From viral meme drinking games you’ll want to share on Insta, to custom dare challenges that get everyone out of their comfort zone, Drinking Dojo is your go-to dojo for unforgettable fun.

## The Best Drinking Games for Every Party Mood

No need for complicated setups or endless rulebooks—these drinking games are easy to pick up, wild enough to break the ice, and perfect for groups big or small.

### 1. Meme Master Mayhem

**What You Need:**
- A stack of printed memes or meme cards (easy to make or grab from Drinking Dojo’s meme drinking games pack)
- Drinks for each player

**How to Play:**
1. Everyone draws a meme card and takes turns reading them aloud.
2. The group votes for the funniest meme.
3. The “winner” gives out drinks to other players.
4. The player with the least funny meme has to do a dare challenge (get creative or use Dare Decks from Drinking Dojo for inspiration).

**Why It Rocks:**  
Instant laughs, zero awkward silence, and a guaranteed icebreaker—plus, who doesn’t love memes with their margarita?

### 2. Dare Roulette

**What You Need:**
- Dare challenges written on slips of paper or loaded up in the [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com/custom-builder)
- A spinning bottle or an app

**How to Play:**
1. Players sit in a circle and spin the bottle.
2. Whoever the bottle points to pulls a dare from the pile or digital deck.
3. Complete the dare or take a sip (or a shot, if you’re feeling bold).

**Pro Tip:**  
Mix in a few NSFW dares if your group is up for spicy surprises!

### 3. Fortnite Drinking Game

**What You Need:**
- A console or PC set up with Fortnite
- Drinks for everyone

**How to Play:**
1. Set simple rules like “Take a sip every time you get eliminated” or “Take a shot if you win a Victory Royale.”
2. Add bonus drinking challenges like “Drink if you drop your controller” or “Sip every time you emote.”

**Why It Rocks:**  
Perfect for gamer squads—add some liquid courage to your next Battle Royale.

### 4. Wedding Party Games

**What You Need:**
- Drinking Dojo’s wedding party games pack or your own set of fun dares and trivia
- Glasses for each guest

**How to Play:**
1. Split everyone into teams (Bride’s Side vs. Groom’s Side, anyone?).
2. Each round, teams draw a card with a mini-game, dare, or trivia question.
3. The losing team drinks, the winners get bragging rights.

**Why It Rocks:**  
Weddings can be formal, but your afterparty doesn’t have to be. Make those toasts unforgettable!

### 5. Custom Challenge Showdown

**What You Need:**
- [Custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com/custom-builder)
- Your imagination

**How to Play:**
1. Build your own drinking game tailored to your group—add inside jokes, viral trends, or region-specific dares (looking at you, Aussies and Danes).
2. Play by the rules you create, and switch it up as you go.

**Why It Rocks:**  
No two games are ever the same, and you get to be the party legend who started a new tradition.
