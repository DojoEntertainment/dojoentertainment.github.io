### Introduction

The "Copa del Rey," or "King's Cup," is one of Spain's most celebrated football competitions, renowned for its drama and excitement. To honor this tradition, we've crafted a drinking game that captures the tournament's intensity and unpredictability. Gather your friends, prepare your materials, and get ready for a night that mirrors the highs and lows of the beautiful game.

- **Scoreboard**: A simple whiteboard or a piece of paper to keep track of points.
- **Shot Glasses**: For special round challenges.

### How to Play

#### Setup

1. **Divide into Teams**: Much like the teams in the Copa del Rey, split your friends into two groups. Each team represents a side in the tournament.
2. **Assign Roles**: Each team should have a captain, a scorekeeper, and a referee to ensure fair play.

#### Game Rules

1. **Kick-off Drink**: Start with a toast to the Copa del Rey. Each player takes a sip of their drink to begin.

   - **Foul**: Whenever a foul occurs, all players must take a sip.
   - **Penalty**: If a penalty is awarded, the team that concedes must take a shot.

3. **Special Rounds**:
   - **Halftime Challenge**: During halftime, hold a mini-football quiz. The losing team drinks.
   - **Extra Time**: If the match goes into extra time, each player finishes their drink as a tribute to the extended play.

4. **Final Whistle**:
   - At the end of the match, the losing team must perform a celebratory dance for the winners, followed by a toast to sportsmanship.
