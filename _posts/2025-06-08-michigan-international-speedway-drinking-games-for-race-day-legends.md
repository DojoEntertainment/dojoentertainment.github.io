Ready to turn your next race day watch party into an absolute banger? Whether you’re pregaming in your living room, tailgating in the garage, or hosting a house party with friends, bringing the energy of Michigan International Speedway to your gathering is a guaranteed win. The key? Epic party drinking games, wild dare challenges, and a touch of meme-fueled mayhem—Drinking Dojo style.

## Why Michigan International Speedway Is Perfect For Drinking Games

There’s something about the roar of engines, crowds in checkered flags, and the suspense of each lap that just screams for a next-level party. NASCAR fans know how to party, and the Michigan International Speedway race weekends are legendary for tailgates, wild stories, and unforgettable drinking challenges.

But you don’t need pit passes to get the full-throttle experience. Grab a cold one, gather your crew, and try these viral drinking games that blend race day hype with classic party fun.

## Michigan Speedway Race Day Drinking Game

### What You’ll Need

- Drinks of your choice (beer, seltzers, cocktails, or non-alcoholic if you’re just vibing)
- A TV or livestream for the race
- Pen and paper (or your phone) to keep track of dares and laps
- Drinking Dojo’s [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) for adding your own twists

### How To Play

**1. Pick Your Driver**  
Each player chooses a NASCAR driver starting the Michigan International Speedway race.

**2. Race Rules**  
Every time one of the following happens, take a drink or complete a dare:

- **Your driver overtakes someone**: Take a sip.
- **Your driver gets overtaken**: Take two sips.
- **Caution flag waves**: Everyone does an NSFW dare (if you’re bold) or a meme drinking game challenge.
- **Your driver pits**: Make a toast to the pit crew and finish your drink.
- **Big crash or spin-out**: Everyone in the room must do a quick dare challenge. Bonus points for acting out a dramatic crash!

**3. House Party Bonus**  
Get extra competitive by adding your own custom dares using the Drinking Dojo builder. Think: “Last place at the end of each lap has to compliment the winner in their best announcer voice.” Or “Anyone who predicts the next yellow flag correctly can assign drinks.”

**4. Victory Lap**  
If your driver wins, you get to assign three drinks to anyone—or spread them out however you want. If your driver loses, you have to do a wild dare (we’re talking NSFW dares if your crew’s up for it).

## Not Just For Race Fans

Even if you’re not a die-hard NASCAR fan, Michigan International Speedway drinking games are the perfect excuse to get rowdy. Throw in some wedding party games or couples drinking games for extra fun. Racing memes, viral dares, and party drinking games are a match made in Drinking Dojo heaven.

## Pro Tips For Race Day Drinking Game Champs

- **Hydrate**: Keep water nearby—racing is a marathon, not a sprint.
- **Snack Up**: Line your pit stop table with classic track snacks—think nachos, hot dogs, and chips.
- **Keep It Social**: Don’t forget to snap some meme-worthy pics for your group chat.  
- **Customize Everything**: Use the [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) to add inside jokes, regional references (shout-out to Michigan, UK, Canada, Australia, and Denmark fans), and wild dares you know will get the party talking.
