Looking for a fresh twist on your next house party or pregame? Meet the Wordle Answer Drinking Game—a wild mashup of viral drinking games, meme drinking games, and classic wordplay. Whether you’re chilling with your mates in London, bringing the squad together in Sydney, or heating up a Friday in Toronto, this party drinking game cranks up the energy (and the dares) to unforgettable levels.

Let’s break down how to play, the rules, and the party essentials you’ll need. Grab your favorite drinks, round up your crew, and get ready for a night of laughs, challenges, and maybe a few epic dares.

## How To Play the Wordle Answer Drinking Game

### What You’ll Need

- **A phone or laptop:** For pulling up the daily Wordle game (or any word puzzle site).
- **Drinks of choice:** From beer to cocktails, whatever your party’s into.
- **A group of legends:** 3+ players is ideal, the more the merrier!
- **Optional:** Dare cards, meme cards, or use the [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) to add your own wild twists.

### Setup

1. **Choose a host:** This person will be in charge of entering guesses and revealing the Wordle answer.
2. **Set the vibe:** You can go classic, NSFW, or themed (think Fortnite drinking game for the gamers, or wedding party games if you’re celebrating big).

## Rules for the Wordle Answer Drinking Game

1. **Guessing Rounds:**  
   - Each round, the group takes turns shouting out or voting on a five-letter word to guess.
   - The host enters the word into the puzzle.

2. **Sips for Misses:**  
   - For every incorrect letter in your guess, everyone takes a sip.
   - If you guess a letter that’s in the word but in the wrong spot, pick one person to take a double sip.

3. **Dare Challenges:**  
   - If you use up all six guesses without cracking the Wordle answer, the whole group has to pull a dare challenge from your custom deck or the [Dare Challenges](https://drinkingdojo.com) pack.
   - For every green letter (right letter, right spot), hand out a sip to anyone of your choice.

4. **Meme Bonus:**  
   - Got a hilarious guess or meme-worthy word? The group votes—if it makes everyone laugh, you hand out a drink.

5. **Victory Cheers:**  
   - Solve the Wordle answer? Lead a group cheers and the last person to raise their glass takes a dare or finishes their drink.

## Why This Game Slaps at Any Party

- **Easy to play:** No need to learn complicated rules—just guess, sip, and dare.
- **Customizable:** Use the [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) to add your own spicy twists, from NSFW dares to themed drinking challenges.
- **Perfect for any crew:** Works for tight-knit couples, massive house parties, and everything in between.
- **Loads of laughs:** Whether you’re into viral drinking games, meme drinking games, or just want some new house party ideas, this one brings the mayhem.

## Pro Tips for Next-Level Fun

- Add regional slang or inside jokes to your guesses for some local flavor (shoutout to mates in the UK, Canada, Australia, and Denmark!).
- Mix in packs for special occasions—try an inauguration day drinking game or even a couples drinking game for date night chaos.
- Make it a tournament: Track wins and losses, and crown a Wordle Answer Drinking Game champ at the end of the night.
