When there’s a holiday today, you know what that means — it’s time to crank up the fun and let the good times roll. Whether you’re chilling with housemates, hosting a wedding bash, or gathering the squad for a legendary night, nothing brings people together quite like party drinking games. At Drinking Dojo, we believe every holiday deserves a little bit of mayhem and a whole lot of unforgettable memories.

Ready to turn a regular day off into a wild celebration? Here’s your ultimate guide to drinking games that’ll have everyone in stitches, plus some fresh dare challenges and meme drinking games to keep things spicy.

## The Classic: Holiday Power Hour

**Materials Needed:**  
- A playlist of bangers (think meme-worthy tracks or holiday-themed hits)  
- Shot glasses for everyone  
- Your beverage of choice

**How to Play:**  
1. Set up your playlist and gather your crew.  
2. Every minute, everyone takes a sip — yes, every single minute, for an hour.  
3. Throw in viral drinking game rules: If a meme song drops (like “Never Gonna Give You Up”), the last to sing along does a dare challenge.  
4. Use our [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) to add your own holiday twists, like “sip if you’re wearing red” or “take two if someone mentions gifts.”

**Why It Rocks:**  
Power Hour is the OG of drinking challenges — simple, fast-paced, and full of laughs. It’s perfect for breaking the ice at any party, from flat gatherings in the UK to BBQs in Australia.

## Daredevil Holiday: Spin to Win

**Materials Needed:**  
- A spinner app or a physical spinner  
- Pre-made NSFW dares or holiday dares written on cards  
- Drinks for everyone

**How to Play:**  
1. Spin the wheel and let fate decide who’s up.  
2. The chosen one must pull a dare card — think “sing your best holiday jingle” or “swap shirts with someone.”  
3. If they chicken out, they drink!  
4. Want to get creative? Use our custom drinking game builder to add inside jokes or regional twists (like “speak in a Danish accent for one round”).

**Why It Rocks:**  
From cheeky NSFW dares to wholesome family fun, Spin to Win is totally customizable. It’s a favorite for house parties, couples drinking games, and even wedding party games.

## Meme Madness: Holiday Edition

**Materials Needed:**  
- A stack of printed memes (holiday or viral, your pick)  
- Drinks

**How to Play:**  
1. Spread the memes face down in the center.  
2. On your turn, draw a meme.  
3. If you can’t relate to the meme, drink. If you can, share your story — if it cracks everyone up, pick someone to drink!

**Why It Rocks:**  
It’s a viral drinking game that brings everyone’s sense of humor front and center. Perfect for breaking the ice and keeping the vibe light, whether you’re chilling in Canada or Denmark.

## Pro Tips for Epic Holiday Drinking Games

- **Hydrate:** Don’t forget water between rounds!  
- **Snacks:** Essential for long sessions — think chips, cheese, or classic party foods.
