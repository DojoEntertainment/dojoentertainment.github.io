3. **Interception**: If the Eagles make an interception, everyone takes two sips. If they fumble, it's one sip for everyone.

4. **Penalty**: Whenever the Eagles get a penalty, take a sip to drown your sorrows.

5. **Commercial Break**: Use commercial breaks to refill your drinks and maybe grab some snacks, but no drinking during this time unless it's part of the game rules.

2. **Instant Replay**: If there's an instant replay of a play, take a sip each time it's shown.
