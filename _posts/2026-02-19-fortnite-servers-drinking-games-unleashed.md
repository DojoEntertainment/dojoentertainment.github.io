Ready to turn your next Fortnite server downtime or late-night squad session into the ultimate party drinking game? At Drinking Dojo, we know that epic wins and hilarious fails deserve epic dares, viral challenges, and a splash of meme-fueled madness. Whether you're vibing in your dorm, kicking off a house party, or hosting a legendary gaming night, we've got the perfect party drinking games for you and your crew.

## Why Fortnite Servers and Drinking Games Are a Match Made in Meme Heaven

Let’s be real: Fortnite servers are the digital playground for millions—so why not level up your squad’s social game IRL? When servers go down or you’re waiting for that next Battle Bus drop, it’s the perfect chance to break out some drinking challenges that are just as wild as your in-game antics. Drinking Dojo’s custom drinking game builder lets you create the ultimate Fortnite-inspired dares, meme drinking games, and viral moments that will keep everyone hyped until Victory Royale.

## What You’ll Need

- **A squad of 2–8 players** (the more, the merrier)
- Your favorite drinks (beer, seltzer, cocktails, or mocktails—your call)
- Access to Fortnite servers (optional, but fun for theme)
- Phones for meme dares and viral challenges
- Dare cards or custom game packs (check out our [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) for instant ideas)

## How To Play: Fortnite Servers Drinking Game

Set up your squad in a circle—controllers in hand or just snacks and drinks at the ready. Decide if you’ll play while the Fortnite servers are up, during downtime, or as a themed house party. Here’s the ultimate ruleset:

### Basic Rules

- **Landing Drop:** Every time you land in a hot zone and survive, nominate someone for a drink. If you’re the first to get knocked, take two drinks!
- **Elimination Station:** Get an elimination? Assign a dare challenge to another player. Miss a shot? Take a sip.
- **Meme Moment:** Pull a meme drinking game card or create your own dare using our custom builder. Think “Do your best Fortnite dance or drink,” or “Invent a new emote and challenge someone to beat it.”
- **Server Crash:** If Fortnite servers go down, everyone takes a group drink and completes a wild group dare—NSFW dares optional (wink).

### Dare Challenges

- **Victory Royale Toast:** Winner of the match makes a custom toast; losers drink.
- **Reboot Roulette:** If you need a reboot, do a dare before you respawn.
- **Storm Chug:** Caught in the storm? Take a drink for every 5 seconds you’re stuck.

### Bonus: Fortnite Server Downtime House Party

Turn server downtime into a full-on party drinking game. Mix in viral drinking games, wedding party games, and couples drinking games for endless variety. Create legendary house party ideas with meme dares, wild challenges, and custom packs from Drinking Dojo.

## Pro Tips for Maximum Mayhem

- Mix in themed snacks (slurp juice, anyone?) for extra immersion.
- Use our [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) to add Fortnite memes, NSFW dares, or election day drinking game twists.
- Keep it safe. Know your limits and remember: the best drinking games are about the laughs, not just the drinks.
