If there’s one thing that can make a classic Ind vs Eng match even more legendary, it’s bringing your crew together for some epic party drinking games. Whether you’re a diehard cricket fan or just here for the wild dare challenges, this is your ultimate guide to turning any viewing party into an unforgettable night. Get ready to blend memes, mayhem, and mischief—Drinking Dojo style.

## What You Need for the Ultimate Ind vs Eng Party Drinking Game

Before the first over is bowled, make sure you’ve got these essentials:
- **Your favorite drinks** (beer, seltzer, cocktails—dealer’s choice)
- **A TV or streaming setup** for the big match
- **Shot glasses or cups**
- **Custom drinking game cards or a DIY builder** (Grab one from [Drinking Dojo’s custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) or whip up your own)
- **Dare cards** (the wilder, the better)
- **Friends ready to play (and maybe scream at the umpire)**

## Ind vs Eng Drinking Game Rules

Here’s how to take the classic cricket rivalry and turn it into a viral drinking game everyone will be talking about:

### Basic Gameplay

1. **Split into Teams:**  
   Supporters of India on one side, England fans on the other. If you’re neutral, pick the underdog or assign teams at random.

2. **Set Up Your Drinks:**  
   Everyone gets a full cup or glass—this is important for the dares and penalty shots.

3. **Game Play:**  
   As the match unfolds, follow these party drinking game rules:

   - **Every Boundary (Four or Six):**  
     The opposing team drinks.
   - **Wickets Lost:**  
     If your team loses a wicket, finish your drink or complete a dare challenge.
   - **Dot Ball Over:**  
     Everyone drinks—no one likes a slow over!
   - **50 Runs or 100 Runs Milestone:**  
     Toast to the batsman and take a group shot.
   - **Dropped Catch:**  
     Drop your own “catch” (your cup)—last person to pick it up does an NSFW dare (if your group is game).
   - **Commentator Clichés:**  
     Every time you hear “good length delivery” or “that’s in the slot,” drink!

4. **Wild Card Meme Challenges:**  
   Mix in meme drinking games—any time a meme-worthy event happens (awkward run-out, dancing fan in the crowd, or a camera zoom on a dramatic coach), the group votes on a dare challenge for one unlucky player.

5. **Customizable Rules:**  
   Use Drinking Dojo’s custom drinking game builder to add your own twists—maybe a Fortnite drinking game round at halftime or a wedding party games crossover if you’re celebrating big.

## Pro Tips for Legendary Ind vs Eng House Parties

- **Theme It Up:**  
  Deck out your space with flags, team colors, and cricket props.
- **Keep Dares Safe (But Spicy):**  
  NSFW dares are fair game for the right crowd—just make sure everyone’s cool with it.
- **Mix in Couples Drinking Games:**  
  Perfect for date night or adding a little rivalry to the romance.
