Ready for a party drinking game that levels up your game night and brings a viral twist to your next house party? Let us introduce you to the Wordle Hint Drinking Game—a killer combo of wordplay, wild dares, and, of course, drinks. Whether you’re hanging out with your mates in London, pregaming in LA, or throwing a wedding rager in Sydney, this custom drinking game builder twist is about to become your new go-to.

## What Is the Wordle Hint Drinking Game?

It’s simple: mix the addictive fun of daily word puzzles with the chaos of classic drinking games. All you need is a group of friends, some drinks, and a bit of competitive spirit. It’s perfect for breaking the ice, sparking inside jokes, and keeping everyone on their toes—whether you’re pulling NSFW dares, tackling meme drinking games, or just vibing with the squad.

## What You Need for This Drinking Game

- **A device** (phone, tablet, or laptop) to display the Wordle of the day or a random five-letter word generator
- **Drinks** (beer, cocktails, shots—your call)
- **A list of dares or challenges** (upgrade the game with our [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com))
- **Friends** (2+ players—no max limit, the more the merrier)

Optional: A notepad for tracking guesses and penalties.

## How To Play The Wordle Hint Drinking Game

### 1. Set Up Your Wordle

- Choose a five-letter word (use the official Wordle, or make one up if you want to get spicy).
- One player is the “Word Master” and secretly enters the word.

### 2. Guessing Rounds

- Each player takes turns guessing a five-letter word.
- After each guess, the Word Master gives hints—just like the original:
  - **Green**: Correct letter, correct spot.
  - **Yellow**: Correct letter, wrong spot.
  - **Gray**: Not in the word.

### 3. Drink and Dare Rules

- **Wrong Letter Penalty**: For every letter in your guess that’s not in the word (gray), take one sip.
- **Yellow Letter Twist**: If you have a yellow letter, you have to do a dare challenge or take two sips. Spice it up with NSFW dares if you’re feeling bold.
- **Green Letter Bonus**: Scored a green? Give out a drink to anyone you choose.
- **Full Miss**: If a player gets zero correct letters, they draw a meme drinking game dare or do a group challenge.
- **Guess Limit**: Players have six guesses—just like the OG Wordle.

### 4. Winning and Losing

- The first person to guess the word is the winner. The losers? They finish their drinks and take on a bonus dare.
- Want to keep the party rolling? Rotate the Word Master and play another round—perfect for house party ideas or even as a wedding party game.
