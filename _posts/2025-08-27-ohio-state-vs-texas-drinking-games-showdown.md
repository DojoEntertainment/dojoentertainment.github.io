### Why Turn Rivalries Into Drinking Games?

Watching Ohio State battle Texas isn’t just about the touchdowns and trash talk—it’s the perfect excuse to gather your crew, break out the dares, and let loose with some viral drinking games. From pregame jitters to celebratory shots, every play can fuel the fun. And with Drinking Dojo’s custom drinking game builder, you can make the rules as wild or as chill as you want.

## Ohio State vs Texas Drinking Game Rules

### What You’ll Need

- **Drinks of choice:** Beer, seltzers, cocktails, or mocktails (no judgment here!)
- **TV or streaming setup:** So you don’t miss a single play
- **Game sheets or phones:** For keeping track of the rules and dares
- **Dare challenge cards:** Optional, but highly recommended for max chaos
- **Team spirit:** Jerseys, face paint, and meme-worthy energy

### How to Play

#### 1. **Pick Your Side**

- Split the group into Team Ohio State and Team Texas. Solo? Assign yourself to a team or just play along with every rule—double the fun, double the drinks.

#### 2. **Basic Rules**

- **Every time your team scores:** Everyone on the opposing team takes a drink.
- **Turnovers:** Everyone shouts “O-H!” or “Hook ‘em!” and the losing side does a dare.
- **Wild plays (interceptions, crazy catches, meme-worthy moments):** Everyone drinks!
- **Commercial breaks:** Quick-fire dare challenges—pull a card or use the Drinking Dojo [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) to generate a random challenge.
- **Halftime:** Each team nominates a player for an epic meme drinking game—think “Guess the Meme” or “NSFW dares” if you really want to spice it up.

#### 3. **Dare Challenges**

- Use a set of pre-made dare cards or create your own online. Some crowd-pleasers:
    - Do your best commentator impersonation
    - Chug for 5 seconds like you’re celebrating a touchdown
    - Share your wildest house party story
    - Take an NSFW dare (for the brave only)
    - Make a meme face for the camera—losers drink

#### 4. **Victory Lap**

- Winning team gets bragging rights (and maybe a “loser drinks” round).
- Snap a group selfie, meme it, and share the chaos—bonus points if you go viral.

## Extra Party Drinking Game Ideas
