Are you ready for a night of laughter, entertainment, and maybe a few surprises? Look no further! We present to you a hilarious drinking game inspired by the one and only Trump. This game is perfect for parties, gatherings, or just a fun night in with friends. So grab your favorite beverage, gather your friends, and letâ€™s dive into the rules and how to play this uproarious game.

### Materials Needed

To get started, you will need the following materials

1. A group of friends (the more, the merrier)
2. Drinks of your choice (beer, cocktails, or even non-alcoholic beverages)
3. A list of Trump-related phrases or quotes (you can find these online or create your own)
4. A timer or stopwatch (optional but useful)
5. A good sense of humor

### How to Play

**Setup**

1. Gather your friends in a comfortable space where everyone can see and hear each other.
2. Prepare a list of Trump-related phrases or quotes. You can use famous speeches, tweets, or funny sayings. Make sure each player has access to the list.
3. Decide on the drink everyone will be using. Ensure that everyone is of legal drinking age.

**Gameplay**

1. Players take turns reading a phrase or quote from the list. 
2. Once a player reads the quote, everyone else must guess if it was actually said by Trump or if it is a made-up quote. 
3. If the player guesses correctly, the person who read the quote takes a drink. If they guess incorrectly, they must take a drink.
4. To make it more exciting, you can set a timer for 30 seconds during which players can discuss their guesses. 
5. For an added twist, you can introduce categories where players can come up with their own Trump-inspired phrases. If someone uses a phrase that is close to something Trump has actually said, they can challenge others to drink.
6. The game continues until everyone has had a chance to read quotes or until you decide to wrap up the fun.

### Tips for a Great Game

- Encourage players to be dramatic in their reading of the quotes. The more exaggerated, the better!
- Use props like wigs or hats to make the game even more entertaining.
- Consider adding additional rules for specific phrases, such as taking a shot for every time a certain word is mentioned.

This drinking game inspired by Trump is sure to create a lively atmosphere filled with laughter and camaraderie. Just remember to drink responsibly and know your limits.
