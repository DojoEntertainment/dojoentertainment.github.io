Movie nights just got a major upgrade. If you’re looking for **party drinking games** that are as wild as your squad, the Together Movie Drinking Game is your ticket to unforgettable nights. It’s the perfect mix of **viral drinking games**, meme-worthy moments, and **dare challenges** — whether you’re chilling on a Friday night, throwing a **house party**, or vibing with your favorite people.

Ready to turn your next movie marathon into a legendary event? Grab your drinks, rally your crew, and let’s get into the rules and ideas for the ultimate Together Movie Drinking Game!

## What You Need

- A copy of Together (streaming or DVD works)
- Drinks of your choice (beer, cocktails, seltzers — whatever your dojo prefers)
- Printed or digital list of rules
- Optional: Dare cards for bonus challenges, and snacks to keep the vibes strong

## How To Play the Together Movie Drinking Game

This isn’t your average movie night. The Together Movie Drinking Game keeps things spicy with custom rules and dares inspired by the best **viral drinking games** out there. Here’s how to get started:

### 1. Set Up Your Dojo

- Gather everyone in front of the screen with their drinks.
- Decide if you want to play in teams or as individuals.
- Distribute your dare cards (optional, but highly recommended for those seeking **NSFW dares** or **meme drinking games** energy).

### 2. The Rules

Whenever the following happens during Together, everyone drinks. Bonus: Assign specific drinks or dare challenges for certain scenes!

#### Take a Sip When:
- Someone says “together”
- Awkward silences happen
- An emotional speech starts
- Someone storms out of a room
- A character makes a questionable life choice

#### Take Two Sips When:
- There’s a major disagreement or fight
- The camera zooms in dramatically
- Someone apologizes (even if they don’t mean it)

#### Finish Your Drink or Do a Dare Challenge When:
- Characters reconcile in a big way
- There’s an epic monologue that leaves everyone speechless
- The movie ends (last one to notice has to do a dare!)

**Pro Tip:** Use Drinking Dojo’s [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) to create your own rules or add inside jokes for your crew!

## Level Up with Dare Challenges

Want to keep things wild? Toss in some dare challenges or **NSFW dares** every time a rule is triggered. Think “do your best dramatic cry,” “confess a secret,” or “text someone a meme-worthy movie quote.” This keeps the energy high and the memories unforgettable.
