## What You Need for the Ireland vs Zimbabwe Drinking Game

- **Players:** 4+ (split into two teams: Ireland and Zimbabwe)
- **Drinks:** Whatever gets you in the spirit — beer, cocktails, soda for the sober warriors
- **Deck of cards** (or use the [Drinking Dojo custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) for a next-level experience)
- **Printed dare challenges** (or improvise on the spot)
- **Scoreboard** (whiteboard, notepad, or phone app)

## How To Play the Ireland vs Zimbabwe Drinking Game

### 1. Form Your Squads

- Divide into two roughly equal teams: Team Ireland and Team Zimbabwe.
- Bonus points for rocking green or red, yellow, and green outfits.

### 2. Set the Stage for Your Party Drinking Games

- Stack your drinks within easy reach.
- Shuffle your deck of cards, or load up a meme drinking games pack from Drinking Dojo.
- Place the scoreboard in the middle.

### 3. Gameplay Rounds

The game runs in rounds, with each team taking turns drawing cards or challenge prompts.

#### **Card Rounds:**

- **Numbered Card:** The player who draws drinks that number (e.g., 5 = 5 sips). Their whole team can split the sips.
- **Face Card:** The opposing team picks a dare challenge for the drawer. Think NSFW dares, meme drinking games, or viral drinking games classics.
- **Ace:** All players do a drinking challenge — last to finish drinks!

#### **Dare Rounds:**

- Every few turns, pause for a “Global Dare.” The team with the lower score must complete a wild dare chosen by the winning team.
- Dares can be themed (e.g., sing your country’s anthem, do your best accent), or use the Drinking Dojo dare packs for inspiration.

### 4. Special Rules to Elevate Your Drinking Challenges

- **Fortnite drinking game twist:** If a player says “Victory Royale,” their team skips a round of drinks.
- **Wedding party games mode:** If someone gets engaged during the game, everyone else must finish their drink. (Hey, it could happen.)
- **Election day drinking game bonus:** If a political debate breaks out, everyone must drink until it’s over.

### 5. How To Win

- First team to 10 points (1 point per completed challenge or round win) gets bragging rights — and picks the next custom drinking game for the group.

## Pro Tips for Next-Level Mayhem with Viral and Meme Drinking Games

- Use the [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) to add your own rules, country-themed dares, or even create a couples drinking games version.
