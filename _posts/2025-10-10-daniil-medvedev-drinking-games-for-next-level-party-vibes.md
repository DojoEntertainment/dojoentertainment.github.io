## What You’ll Need

- A TV or streaming device to watch a Daniil Medvedev tennis match (YouTube highlights work if there’s no live match)

## How To Play The Daniil Medvedev Drinking Game

This viral drinking game is flexible—play with as many friends as you like. The main goal: turn every twist and turn of a Medvedev match into a reason to drink, dare, and laugh until you drop.

### Basic Rules

1. **Pick Your Medvedev Moments**  
   Before the match starts, everyone chooses a few classic Daniil Medvedev antics or signature moves (think: arguing with the umpire, sarcastic applause, wild baseline rallies, or his iconic deadpan reactions).

2. **Set Up The Dare Challenges**  
   Use [Drinking Dojo’s custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) to create NSFW dares or clean ones—whatever fits your party vibe. Each Medvedev moment is paired with a drinking challenge or dare.

3. **Start The Match And The Mayhem**  
   Every time Medvedev does your chosen move, everyone who picked that move takes a sip, a shot, or completes a dare challenge.

4. **Meme It Up**  
   Assign someone to create meme captions for the best Medvedev reactions during the match. The group votes on the funniest meme; loser does an extra dare or finishes their drink.

5. **Wildcard Round**  
   If Medvedev wins a set with a wild comeback, everyone must pick a random dare from the pile—no exceptions.
