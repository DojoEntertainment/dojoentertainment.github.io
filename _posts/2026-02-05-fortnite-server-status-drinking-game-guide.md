When Fortnite server status goes from “online” to “unexpected downtime,” you know the pain. But before you rage-quit or start scrolling through endless memes, why not turn the wait into the ultimate house party idea? Enter: the Fortnite Server Status Drinking Game—where downtime becomes prime time for party drinking games, dare challenges, and a shot at unforgettable mayhem.

## Why Play a Fortnite Server Status Drinking Game?

Maybe you’re waiting out an update, or the servers just crashed mid-victory royale. Instead of getting salty, grab your squad (IRL this time), pour some drinks, and turn that frustration into a night you’ll actually want to remember (or at least, have your friends remind you about).

This game is perfect for:

- Dorm rooms and house parties  
- Chilling with friends during server outages  
- Pairing with viral drinking games and meme drinking games  
- Fortnite fans across the US, UK, Canada, Australia, and Denmark

## What You Need

- **A group of 3+ players** (the more, the wilder)  
- **Drinks of your choice** (beer, cocktails, or non-alcoholic for the brave)  
- **Phones or laptops** to check the Fortnite server status updates  
- **A deck of dare cards** (or use Drinking Dojo’s custom drinking game builder for NSFW dares and meme-worthy challenges)  

## How To Play

### Setup

1. **Everyone gets a drink** and grabs their phone or laptop.  
2. **Open the official Fortnite server status page** and keep refreshing—this is now your “game timer.”  
3. **Shuffle your dare challenges deck** or generate dares using the [Drinking Dojo custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com).  

### Game Rules

#### Main Game

- **Every time the server status changes** (from “Operational” to “Major Outage,” etc.), everyone takes a sip.  
- **If Epic Games posts a new update** (like “Investigating” or “Identified”), last person to notice does a dare challenge.  
- **If servers come back online:**  
    - Everyone cheers and takes a final victory drink.  
    - The MVP (person who spotted it first) gets to assign a meme drinking game challenge to anyone.  

#### Bonus Dare Challenges

- **Server status hasn't changed for 10 minutes?**  
  Draw a dare card—could be NSFW, meme, or classic.  
- **See a meme about the outage on Twitter or Reddit?**  
  Share it with the group. Funniest meme wins a free pass on their next dare.  
- **Someone tries to sneak off to play another game (like a sneaky Fortnite traitor)?**  
  They do a double dare, no questions asked.  

## Pro Tips for Epic Nights

- Mix in couples drinking games if you’ve got pairs in your group.  
- Up the ante with themed drinks (Victory Royale Vodka, anyone?).  
- Use Drinking Dojo’s custom tools to create your own Fortnite-inspired dares and drinking challenges—perfect for wedding party games, house parties, or even inauguration day drinking game spinoffs.  

## Make Every Server Outage Legendary

Downtime doesn’t have to mean a downer. Next time you see Fortnite server status go red, round up your crew, crack open a cold one, and turn it into the most viral drinking game moment of the week.
