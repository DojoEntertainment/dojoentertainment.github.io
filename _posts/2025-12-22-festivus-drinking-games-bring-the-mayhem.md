Ready to shake up your classic Festivus gathering? Skip the tired tinsel and bring on the viral drinking games, custom dares, and meme-fueled chaos. Whether you’re hosting a house party in Toronto, a cheeky pub night in London, or just want unforgettable party drinking games for your crew, Drinking Dojo has you covered. Let’s turn Festivus into the ultimate excuse for drinking challenges, NSFW dares, and all-out fun.

### What You Need for Festivus Drinking Games

Before you start bending the rules (and maybe your dignity), gather these essentials:

- A big table (for the Feats of Strength and dare challenges)
- Drinks of your choice (beer, wine, cocktails, or mocktails)
- Cups or shot glasses
- A printed or digital list of Festivus-themed dares and meme drinking games
- Friends with a sense of humor (and maybe a thick skin)
- Optional: A pole for the true Festivus spirit

### How to Play Festivus Drinking Games

#### 1. Airing of Grievances

Nothing says Festivus like letting it all out. Take turns “airing grievances” — but with a twist:

- Each player shares a (funny, lighthearted) grievance about someone in the group.
- The person being roasted must either take a drink or complete a dare from the **custom drinking game builder** at [Drinking Dojo](https://drinkingdojo.com).
- Want to spice it up? Add meme drinking games: read a trending meme out loud, and if it fits the person, they drink.

#### 2. Festivus Feats of Strength

Time for some physical fun (no wrestling required):

- Players challenge each other to silly drinking challenges. Examples: hold a plank while chugging a drink, balance a cup on your head, or see who can stack the most bottle caps.
- Winner gets to assign drinks or dare challenges to anyone at the table.
- Try a themed dare pack with NSFW dares if you’re feeling bold (and your group can handle it).

#### 3. Festivus Dare Roulette

Bring in the viral drinking games energy:

- Write dares (from mild to wild) on slips of paper and toss them in a hat.
- Players draw dares at random, and have to complete them or take two drinks.
- For a next-level experience, use the **custom drinking game builder** to make this truly your own.

#### 4. Meme Drinking Game

Because nothing says “party” like memes and mayhem:

- Everyone brings their favorite meme (printed, on their phone, or described).
- If your meme gets the most laughs, you hand out drinks.
- If your meme flops, you face a dare challenge or take a shot.

### Festivus Drinking Games Rules

- Respect everyone’s boundaries — if a dare’s too much, swap it out.
- No phones during dares (unless you’re sharing a meme).
- Keep it light, keep it wild, and remember: it’s all about unforgettable memories.
- Drink water and pace yourself — nobody needs a Festivus “miracle” hangover.

### House Party Ideas for the Ultimate Festivus Bash

- Set up a Festivus “pole” photo booth with props.
- Play background clips of classic Festivus moments (for the US, UK, Canada, Australia, or Denmark editions).
- Add in couples drinking games for a spicy twist if you’re partying with your partner.
