## How To Play: NFL Picks Drinking Game with Dare Challenges

### 1. Make Your Picks

Before kickoff, everyone fills out their predictions for each NFL week 5 matchup. Go wild with your guesses—underdogs, upsets, or straight-from-the-meme-universe bets.

- Each player must pick winners for every game.
- Optional: Add bonus props like “first touchdown scorer” or “most meme-worthy play.”

### 2. Assign Dare Challenges

For each matchup, assign a dare challenge to the loser(s). Use classic dares, viral drinking games, or get spicy with NSFW dares for adults-only parties. Drinking Dojo’s custom drinking game builder can help you create unique dares for every NFL twist.

### 3. Game Time Sips

Throughout each game, spice up the action with these rules:

- **Your Pick Scores:** Take a celebratory sip.
- **Your Pick Fumbles:** Do a dare challenge, or take a double sip.
- **Meme Moment (unexpected play, epic fail, viral dance):** Everyone drinks!
- **Tie Breaker:** If a game goes to overtime, last person to shout “Drinking Dojo!” picks someone to finish their drink.

### 4. Tally Up and Crown the Drinking Champion
