## How To Play Daily Horoscope Drinking Games

### 1. Set Up The Signs

- Have each player announce their zodiac sign (no faking, or the stars will know).
- Grab your daily horoscope online or use an app—just a quick read to set the mood.

### 2. Assign The Rules

Each zodiac sign gets a unique rule for the night. Here are some ideas to get you started:

- **Aries**: Must shout “Let’s go!” before every drink, or take an extra sip.
- **Taurus**: Can make anyone swap seats with them once per round.
- **Gemini**: Speaks in accents for one round—mess up, take a drink.
- **Cancer**: Can play matchmaker—choose two people to do a dare together.
- **Leo**: Must give a toast before the group drinks.
- **Virgo**: Corrects someone’s grammar, that person drinks.
- **Libra**: Decides tie-breakers in any dare challenge.
- **Scorpio**: Can dare anyone to reveal a secret or take two drinks.
- **Sagittarius**: Can invent a new rule at any point.
- **Capricorn**: Can veto any dare but must take a drink instead.
- **Aquarius**: Must meme every situation—if they don’t, they drink.
- **Pisces**: Can ask any player a question—wrong answer means a sip.

### 3. Add Daily Dare Challenges

Each player checks their daily horoscope and picks out a theme word or vibe (love, luck, drama, etc.). Then:

- **If your horoscope predicts good luck**: You can skip any dare once.
- **If it’s about love**: Pair up with someone for the next round of dares.
- **If it’s dramatic**: Double your next challenge or dare.

Mix in meme drinking games by having someone look up the “Zodiac sign memes” for the group—whoever laughs first, drinks!

### 4. Keep It Going
