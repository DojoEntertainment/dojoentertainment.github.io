Ready to mix some gridiron action with legendary drinking games? As NFL power rankings week 2 heats up, there’s no better way to turn Sunday football into an epic party than with a custom drinking game built for the ultimate fans. Whether you’re hosting a wild house party, chilling with your crew, or searching for fresh party drinking games, Drinking Dojo has you covered. Grab your squad, pick your favorite team (or your least favorite, that’s half the fun), and let’s turn those touchdowns into unforgettable dares.

## What You Need

- **TV or stream with the NFL game**
- **Drinks of choice** (beer, cocktails, soft drinks—dealer’s choice)
- **Printed or digital copy of the rules**
- **Optional:** Drinking Dojo dare challenges, meme drinking games packs, and custom drinking game builder ([check them out here!](https://drinkingdojo.com))

## How To Play

1. **Choose Teams:**  
   Everyone picks a team from the current NFL power rankings week 2. If your group has die-hard fans, let loyalties fly. For a twist, assign teams randomly or based on jersey color.

2. **Set Up the Rules:**  
   Here’s the base set—add your own custom dares or NSFW dares for extra spice!

   - **Touchdown Toast:**  
     When your team scores a touchdown, everyone else drinks. If it’s a defensive or special teams TD, double it.

   - **Turnover Trouble:**  
     If your team turns the ball over (fumble, interception), you drink and pick someone to join you.

   - **Field Goal Fizz:**  
     Every made field goal? Everyone sips. Missed field goal? Chug for 5 seconds.

   - **Power Rankings Pick:**  
     If your team is ranked higher and loses a quarter, do a dare challenge from the Drinking Dojo meme drinking games pack.

   - **Flag Frenzy:**  
     Every time the refs throw a flag, last person to touch their drink takes a sip.

   - **Announcer Bingo:**  
     Pick a phrase (“momentum shift,” “red zone,” “underdog story”). First to catch it on air makes someone else drink.

   - **Bonus Meme Round:**  
     At halftime, everyone must share or create a meme about the game. Best meme wins—loser does a dare.

3. **Customize With Drinking Dojo:**  
   Use the [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) to add viral drinking games, Fortnite drinking game rules, or even wedding party games for the next big event.

## House Party Ideas and Tips

- **Theme it up:** Jerseys, face paint, and team colors crank up the fun.
- **Snack attack:** Stack up on chips, wings, or whatever your crew loves.
- **Keep it safe:** Hydrate and pace yourself. The best drinking challenges are the ones you remember.
