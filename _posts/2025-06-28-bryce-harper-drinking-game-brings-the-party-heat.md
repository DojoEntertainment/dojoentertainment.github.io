Ready to knock your next party out of the park? If you’re a fan of drinking games and wild dares, the Bryce Harper Drinking Game is set to become your new house party MVP. Whether you’re pregaming for the big match, chilling with friends, or looking for party drinking games that’ll have everyone buzzing, this one’s got your bases covered.

From viral drinking games to meme drinking games, Drinking Dojo is always looking for the next big hit. The Bryce Harper Drinking Game is all about high energy, big swings, and unforgettable moments—just like the man himself.

## What You Need to Play

- **A group of friends** (ideal for 4–12 players)
- **Drinks of choice** (beer, cider, seltzer—your call)
- **A TV or laptop** to stream a Phillies game or Bryce Harper highlight reel (YouTube works!)
- **Printed or digital list of dare challenges** (see below)
- **Optional:** Baseball caps, jerseys, or any Phillies swag for extra fun

## How to Play The Bryce Harper Drinking Game

You don’t need to know every baseball stat to play—just bring your party spirit.

### Setup

1. **Split into two teams**: Team Phillies (Harper fans) and Team Challengers.
2. **Choose a Game Master** to keep track of the action and call out the dares.
3. **Pour your drinks** and queue up a Phillies game or Bryce Harper highlights.

### The Rules

- **Every time Bryce Harper is mentioned by the commentators:**  
  *Everyone drinks.*

- **When Bryce gets a hit, home run, or makes a crazy play:**  
  *Team Phillies chooses a dare challenge for Team Challengers.*

- **If Bryce strikes out or gets caught stealing:**  
  *Team Challengers picks a dare for Team Phillies.*

- **Harper’s iconic hair flip or helmet toss:**  
  *Last person to mimic the move takes a big sip.*

- **Bonus round for meme lovers:**  
  If a Harper meme or gif pops up on your social feed, everyone must do their best Harper impression. Worst impression? Finish your drink.

### Dare Challenges (For Extra Mayhem)

- Recite a baseball chant in your best announcer voice
- Do a dramatic slow-motion home run trot around the room
- Invent a new NSFW dare (if your crew’s up for it)
- Chug from a baseball cap (if you dare)
- Pose for an epic “catch” photo for your group chat
