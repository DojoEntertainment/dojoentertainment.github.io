Whether you’re chilling in a dorm, throwing a house party, or looking for wild wedding party games, the Ind vs Nam drinking game is your new ticket to unforgettable moments. We’re talking memes, dares, and all the party drinking games vibes you need to spice up that cricket fever.

## What You Need

- A TV or livestream for the Ind vs Nam match
- Your favorite drinks (beer, cocktails, shots—whatever keeps your dojo strong)
- Friends ready for dare challenges
- Printed or digital rule list (save this post!)
- Optionally: dare cards, meme cards, or the [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) for spicy, personalized rounds

## How To Play

This viral drinking game is simple, hilarious, and guaranteed to get wild fast. Here are the basic rules, but feel free to bend the rules or add NSFW dares if your crew’s brave enough.

### The Rules

1. **Pick Your Team**
   - Everyone chooses either Ind or Nam. If it’s a big group, split evenly or let chaos decide.

2. **Take a Sip When…**
   - Your team scores a boundary (4 or 6 runs)
   - A player on your team gets out
   - The commentators make a meme-worthy comment (think: “That’s gone miles!”)
   - The camera finds a wild fan in costume

3. **Dare Challenge When…**
   - The umpire reviews a decision (everyone draws a dare challenge—try some NSFW dares for extra spice)
   - Drinks get spilled (the culprit must do a dare or take two sips)

4. **Shot Time**
   - If your team hits a six and the next ball is a wicket, everyone on the other team takes a shot

5. **Custom Meme Rule**
   - If a meme you predicted shows up (like the infamous “fan with a sign”), everyone else drinks. Use the [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) to create your own meme drinking game rules!

6. **Final Over Frenzy**
   - In the last over, every run scored = one sip for the opposing team. If a wicket falls, dare challenges double.

### Pro Tips

- Make it a Fortnite drinking game crossover: losers have to do a Fortnite dance in front of everyone.
- Add election day or inauguration day drinking game rules for extra chaos during international breaks.
- Playing as a couple? Turn it into a couples drinking game—winning pair gets to make up a new rule for the next round.
