Ready to turn your next night in or house party into a wild, unforgettable experience? The Mega Millions Lottery Drinking Game brings the thrill of jackpot dreams to your living room—no ticket needed, just good friends and your favorite drinks. Whether you’re vibing with your crew, celebrating a big win, or just looking for fresh party drinking games, this one’s bound to go viral in your group chat.

## What You Need

- The official Mega Millions drawing (streamed live or results online)
- Drinks of your choice (beer, cocktails, or mocktails work)
- A way to keep track of numbers (pen and paper, or your phone)
- Prizes or dare challenges for bonus fun

## How to Play Mega Millions Lottery Drinking Game

### 1. **Pick Your Numbers**  
Each player writes down six numbers (five main numbers, one Mega Ball) between 1–70 and 1–25 for the Mega Ball, just like in the real lottery. You can choose to make it a meme drinking game by letting everyone pick the most ridiculous numbers they can think of—lucky socks, ex’s birthdays, you name it.

### 2. **Place Your Bets**  
Decide what happens if you get a match:
- **1 number matched:** Take 1 drink
- **2 numbers matched:** Take 2 drinks
- **3 numbers matched:** Choose someone to take a drink
- **4 numbers matched:** Assign a dare challenge (NSFW dares if you’re feeling bold)
- **5 numbers matched:** Everyone else drinks, you’re the legend
- **Mega Ball matched:** Winner picks a viral dare from Drinking Dojo’s [dare challenge packs](https://drinkingdojo.com)
- **Jackpot (all numbers):** You’re the Mega Millions champ—everyone else finishes their drink and the winner gets a prize (think shots, a meme trophy, or bragging rights)

### 3. **Watch the Draw**  
Stream the Mega Millions drawing, or check the results online together. As each number is called, players cross off their matches and get ready to drink or dish out dares.

### 4. **Add a Twist**  
Want to make it even wilder? Try custom rules:
- If nobody matches any numbers, everyone takes a group drink.
- For every number called that’s also someone’s birthday, they lead the next dare challenge.
- Got a couple in the group? Toss in a couples drinking games round—if your partner matches more numbers than you, prepare for a spicy dare.
