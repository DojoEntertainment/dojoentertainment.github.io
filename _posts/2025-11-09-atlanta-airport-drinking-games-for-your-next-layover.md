If you’ve ever found yourself stuck at Atlanta airport—yes, the busiest one on the planet—you know those layovers can drag on. But what if you could turn that waiting game into an unforgettable party drinking game session? Whether you’re traveling solo, with your partner, or rolling deep with a crew, Drinking Dojo has you covered with custom drinking game builder packs, viral drinking games, and dare challenges designed to make even the most boring gate feel like a VIP lounge.

Let’s turn your next ATL layover into the ultimate pregame, complete with meme drinking games and NSFW dares (if you’re feeling brave and your flight’s not for a while). Ready to make your airport experience legendary? Here’s everything you need.

## Atlanta Airport Drinking Game Rules

### What You’ll Need

- Drinks (grab a beer, wine, or your favorite airport cocktail—just respect airport rules)
- Your phone (for accessing [Drinking Dojo dare challenges and custom packs](https://drinkingdojo.com))
- At least one partner in crime (but the more the merrier)
- A little bit of boldness (you’re in public, after all)

### How To Play

1. **Pick Your Game Mode**  
   - **Classic Dare Challenges:** Open up Drinking Dojo’s dare challenge packs and take turns completing wild tasks—like photo-bombing a group selfie in the food court or serenading your gate agent.  
   - **Meme Drinking Games:** Use the custom drinking game builder to create meme-inspired challenges based on what you see at the airport. (“Drink if you spot someone running for their gate!”)  
   - **Viral Drinking Games:** Try to get your group trending with a social media challenge—like a TikTok dance-off by the departure board. Loser takes a shot!

2. **Airport Bingo**  
   - Make a bingo card of classic Atlanta airport sights: someone sleeping on their suitcase, a wild security line, Chick-fil-A cravings, or a surprise gate change. Each time you spot one, assign a sip, a dare, or an NSFW challenge (if your crew’s up for it).

3. **Couples Drinking Games**  
   - Traveling with your partner? Spice up your layover with flirty dares, truth-or-drink questions, or even wedding party games for the honeymooners headed south.

4. **Last Call Challenge**  
   - When your flight’s about to board, race to finish your drinks (responsibly!). Last one done has to do a TikTok-worthy dare at the gate.

## Pro Tips for ATL Party Drinking Games

- Always respect airport rules and local laws—no public intoxication!  
- Stick to designated bar areas for the best vibes and fewer side-eyes.
