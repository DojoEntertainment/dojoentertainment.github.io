### Game Rules

   Each time an artist from the Coachella 2025 lineup is mentioned, take a sip. If you have a favorite artist, cheer and take an extra sip

2. **Song Identification**  
   Whenever someone recognizes a song being played from the lineup, everyone else takes a sip. Bonus sip if you can name the album it’s from

3. **Dance Break**  
   If a dance-off breaks out among your group, everyone else must finish their drink by the end of the song

4. **Surprise Collaboration**  
   If a surprise collaboration happens during a live stream, everyone takes two sips and toasts to the unexpected

5. **Throwback Track**  
   Whenever an artist plays a throwback track from before 2020, it’s time to take a trip down memory lane with three sips

6. **Festival Fashion**  
   Spot someone wearing iconic festival fashion or flower crowns and it’s time for a group drink

7. **Random Shoutout**  
   If a performer gives a shoutout to a random city or person, the last person to raise their glass takes a sip

   For every encore performance, it's bottoms up for the entire group
