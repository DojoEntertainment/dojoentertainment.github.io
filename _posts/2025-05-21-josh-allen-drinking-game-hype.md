Ready to level up your next party with one of the most viral drinking games this season? If you and your crew are football fans (or just love a good time), the Josh Allen Drinking Game is about to become your new favorite pregame ritual, Sunday Funday tradition, or wild house party idea. With meme-level dares, easy rules, and a sprinkle of chaos, this party drinking game brings everyone together—Buffalo Bills fans and casuals alike.

Whether you're tailgating, chilling at home, or throwing a wedding rager where the dance floor needs a boost, Josh Allen drinking games are the ultimate way to make every play unforgettable.

## What You Need for the Josh Allen Drinking Game

- A TV or livestream showing any Buffalo Bills game
- Your favorite drinks (beer, seltzers, cocktails—whatever fuels your squad)
- Dare challenge cards or a custom drinking game builder ([Drinking Dojo has you covered](https://drinkingdojo.com))
- Optional: Bills merch, table for "jumping" (do not try this at home—we're not responsible for broken furniture!)

## How to Play the Josh Allen Drinking Game: Rules & Dare Challenges

The rules are simple, but the fun is next-level. Here’s how to set it up:

### Basic Rules for This Viral Drinking Game

1. **Pick Your Players**  
   Gather your friends—this game works for duos, small groups, or the whole house party.

2. **Assign Drinks**  
   Everyone pours their drink of choice. Keep it chill or go for NSFW dares if your crew is feeling spicy.

3. **Game Time Events**  
   Every time one of these Josh Allen moments happens, follow the dare or drink challenge:

   - **Josh Allen Throws a Touchdown:**  
     Everyone cheers and takes 2 sips. The last person to stand up does a dare challenge.

   - **Allen Rushes for a First Down:**  
     First person to yell "QB1" gives out 2 drinks.

   - **Allen Gets Sacked:**  
     Everyone drinks until the replay ends.

   - **Allen Throws an Interception:**  
     All Bills fans drink. Non-Bills fans assign a drinking challenge (or meme dare).

   - **Allen Hurdles a Defender:**  
     Group vote: Best touchdown celebration dance wins, loser finishes their drink.

   - **Bills Score a Field Goal:**  
     If you called it, hand out 3 sips. If not, do a dare from the meme drinking games deck.

### Bonus Dare Challenges to Boost Your Party Drinking Games

- **Fortnite Victory Dance:**  
  After any Allen rushing TD, do your best Fortnite dance—worst dancer drinks.

- **Wedding Party Games Twist:**  
  If anyone in the group has been to a wedding this year, they assign a custom dare (think NSFW or meme-worthy).

- **Election Day & Inauguration Day Drinking Game Rule:**  
  If the Bills are playing during a big event day (like Election Day or Inauguration Day), double all dares for 10 minutes.

## Why Josh Allen Drinking Games Rock for Your Next Party

These drinking games aren’t just for hardcore football fans—they’re built for anyone who wants wild, social, and memorable party vibes.
