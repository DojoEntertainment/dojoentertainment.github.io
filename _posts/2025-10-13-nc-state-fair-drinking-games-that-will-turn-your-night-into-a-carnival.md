So why not bring all the fun home with your crew? We’re serving up the best party drinking games inspired by everything you love about the NC State Fair—think dare challenges, meme madness, and unforgettable vibes.

Whether you’re pregaming for the real thing, throwing a state fair–themed bash, or just vibing with friends, these drinking games are guaranteed to crank up the mayhem. Ready for the ultimate house party ideas? Let’s dive straight into the rules, how to play, and all the gear you’ll need.

## The Ultimate NC State Fair Drinking Game for Adults 18–35

### What You’ll Need for Wild Party Drinking Games

- Your drink of choice (beer, seltzer, cocktails—dealer’s choice)
- A deck of cards
- Pennies or tokens (think carnival prizes)
- Printed or digital list of dares and meme challenges (pro tip: use the [Drinking Dojo custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) for wild ideas)
- State fair snacks (optional, but highly recommended)

### How To Play These Viral Drinking Games

1. **Set the Scene**  
   Decorate your space with state fair vibes—bunting, paper tickets, fake mustaches, and as many snacks as you can handle.

2. **Deal the Cards**  
   Each card suits a classic state fair attraction. Here’s the basic breakdown:
   - **Hearts:** Food challenge (take a bite, then a sip)
   - **Diamonds:** Dare challenges (think “show us your best pig call” or “do a TikTok dance”)
   - **Clubs:** Meme drinking games (whoever can’t come up with a meme for a fair moment drinks)
   - **Spades:** Carnival mini-games (toss a penny in a cup—miss, you drink)

3. **Spin the Dares**  
   Whenever a player draws a dare card, they must complete an NSFW dare, a meme challenge, or one of Drinking Dojo’s viral drinking games from your custom pack. Not up for it? Double the drinks.

4. **Win Prizes, Win Drinks**  
   Land a “prize token” (aka a penny) with any mini-game? Hand out drinks to any player you want. Rake in the tokens, become the party MVP.

5. **Grand Finale: The Ferris Wheel Spin**  
   At any time, a player can shout “Ferris Wheel!” and spin around three times. Everyone else has to finish their drink or chug until the spinner stops. Only one Ferris Wheel per player per night—so use it wisely.
