## What You Need for Your Ind vs Eng Test Drinking Game

Before the first bowl is thrown, make sure you’re set up with essentials for your drinking games session:

- Drinks (your weapon of choice—beer, cocktails, mocktails, whatever)
- Scorecards or Drinking Dojo’s [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) for personalized game packs
- List of dares (NSFW dares for the brave, or keep it light with meme drinking games)
- A TV, laptop, or stream for the Ind vs Eng Test match
- Friends, family, or that one mate who thinks they’re a cricket expert

## How To Play The Ind vs Eng Test Drinking Game: Rules & Dare Challenges

### 1. Set Up Your Teams

Divide into Team India and Team England (or mix it up if you’re feeling competitive). If you’re a big group, let everyone pick their player to “support” for personal dares and drinking challenges.

### 2. The Rules for This Viral Drinking Game

Keep it simple, or go wild with our custom rules. Here are the basics for this party drinking game:

- **Wicket Falls:** Everyone supporting the dismissed team takes a drink.
- **Boundary Hit (Four or Six):** All players on the opposing team take a sip.
- **Maiden Over:** Everyone does a dare challenge from the list.
- **LBW Decision:** Quick meme drinking game—first to send a cricket meme in the group chat skips the next drink.
- **Fifty or Century Scored:** Toast to the batter—finish your drink, or pass out a wild NSFW dare to another player.
- **Dropped Catch:** Everyone groans—then the last person to shout “Butterfingers!” takes two drinks.
- **Commentator Cliché Bingo:** Write down classic cricket catchphrases (“corridor of uncertainty,” “that’s a peach,” etc.). When you hear one, first to call it out can hand out a dare challenge.

### 3. Dare Challenges and Meme Drinking Games Ideas

- Speak in a British or Indian accent for the next over
