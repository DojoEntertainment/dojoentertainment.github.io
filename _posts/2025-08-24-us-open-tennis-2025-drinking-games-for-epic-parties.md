## What You Need To Play Drinking Games for US Open Tennis 2025

## How To Play The US Open Tennis 2025 Drinking Game

This isn’t just any drinking game. We’re bringing Drinking Dojo energy—expect viral drinking games moves, custom rules, and legendary dare challenges.

### Basic Rules for Party Drinking Games

**Assign Players:**  
Pick a player or doubles team to “represent” each person or group at your party.

**Take A Sip When:**
- Your player misses a serve
- Any player argues with the umpire
- There’s a replay challenge
- The camera zooms in on a celebrity in the crowd

**Take Two Sips When:**
- Someone aces a serve
- A player slips or falls
- The match goes to a tiebreak

**Finish Your Drink If:**
- There’s a rain delay (extra points for miming tennis with your empty cup!)
- Your player loses in straight sets

### Dare Challenges to Amp Up Your Drinking Game

Every time the commentators say *“unbelievable”* or *“what a rally,”* the last person to yell “Cheers!” has to draw a dare card. Include NSFW dares for late-night vibes, or keep it friendly with meme drinking games for daytime hangs.
