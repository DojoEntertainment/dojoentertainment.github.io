In the magical world of Harry Potter, anything is possibleâ€”even a night of enchanting fun with friends inspired by the talented Jessie Cave, who played the quirky yet lovable Lavender Brown. Whether you're a die-hard Potterhead or simply looking for a unique way to spice up your game night, this Harry Potter-inspired drinking game will have you laughing, bonding, and maybe even casting a spell or two. Perfect for fans of the series and admirers of Jessie Cave's memorable performance, this game will bring a touch of Hogwarts magic to your gathering.

#### How to Play

**Materials Needed:**
- A copy of any Harry Potter film or audiobook
- Drinks of your choice (butterbeer for the authentic experience!)
- Friends who are ready for magical fun

**Basic Rules:**

1. **Select the Film or Chapter:** Choose any Harry Potter film or audiobook chapter that features Lavender Brown. If you're feeling particularly inspired by Jessie Cave, you might want to pick "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince," where her character really shines.

2. **Set Up Your Drinks:** Make sure everyone has their drink of choice ready. You can opt for non-alcoholic versions if that's more your style.

3. **Drink When:**
   - Lavender Brown appears on screen or is mentioned in the audiobook.
   - Lavender gives Ron Weasley a particularly intense look.
   - Any character casts a spell.
   - Hermione rolls her eyes at Lavender.
   - Hagrid makes an appearance.
   - Someone mentions Quidditch.

4. **Special Jessie Cave Rule:** Whenever Lavender says, "Won-Won," everyone must perform their best Jessie Cave impression before taking a sip.

5. **The Sorting Hat Rule:** At the start of the game, everyone chooses a Hogwarts house to represent. If a character from your house performs a notable action (like winning a Quidditch match or defeating a Death Eater), everyone in that house takes a celebratory sip.

#### Tips for a Magical Evening

- **Dress the Part:** Encourage guests to wear their favorite Harry Potter attire. Bonus points for anyone who comes dressed as Lavender Brown!
  
- **Custom Cocktails:** Create themed drinks like "Felix Felicis" or "Amortentia" to add an extra layer of fun.

- **Keep it Safe:** As with any game involving drinks, be sure to pace yourself and know your limits. This game is about fun and camaraderie, not overindulgence.

By incorporating the charm of Harry Potter and the delightful energy of Jessie Cave's performance, this game is sure to enchant your evening with laughter and unforgettable memories. So, gather your wands, summon your friends, and prepare for a night of spellbinding fun! And remember, for more exciting drinking game ideas, check out [Drinking Dojo](https://drinkingdojo.com).
