It’s that time of year—friends are gathering, jerseys are out, and the snacks are stacked. But if you want to level-up your Champions League Final party, you need more than just big screens and cold drinks. Enter the ultimate party drinking games, meme drinking games, and wild dare challenges—custom-built to turn every goal, save, and VAR controversy into a night no one will forget.

Whether you’re watching with diehard fans, casual observers, or a crew who just wants an excuse to party, these drinking games are designed to keep the energy high and the drinks flowing. Ready to make your Champions League Final unforgettable? Let’s do this.

## Champions League Final Drinking Game Rules

**What you need:**
- Drinks of your choice (beer, seltzer, cocktails—your call)
- A TV or streaming setup
- Drinking cups or shot glasses
- A printed or digital list of dares (optional: use Drinking Dojo’s [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) for a personalized experience)
- Good vibes

### Classic Match Moments

Every epic match deserves a classic set of party drinking games. Try these simple rules to get started:

- **Kickoff:** Everyone takes a sip as the match starts.
- **Corner Kick:** Last person to shout “corner” drinks.
- **Goal Scored:** Fans of the team that concedes take two sips. Fans of the scoring team assign a dare.
- **Yellow Card:** Everyone wearing the same color as the carded player drinks.
- **Red Card:** Everyone finishes their drink.
- **VAR Check:** Everyone freezes—last person to stop moving drinks.
- **Missed Penalty:** Whole room does a group dare challenge.
- **Halftime:** Time for NSFW dares or a quick meme drinking game (think: “caption this moment” with a drink penalty for the worst meme).

### Viral Drinking Games for the Final

Want to go viral at your house party? Try this meme drinking game format:

- **Meme Moment:** Every time the commentators say a phrase that could be a meme (“he gave 110 percent,” “it’s a game of two halves”), everyone shouts out a meme caption. Funniest one gets to choose who drinks.
- **Fan Cam Fail:** If you spot a fan doing something wild on camera, everyone drinks except the person who called it out.

### Dare Challenges for Extra Spice

Crank up the mayhem with some dare challenges between plays:

- **Dare Card Draw:** Write wild dares on cards before the match. Every time there’s a substitution, someone draws a card and does the dare.
- **Streaker Alert:** If there’s a pitch invader, everyone has to complete a group dare challenge (like singing your team’s chant at the top of your lungs).

### Couples Drinking Games and More

Watching with your partner or a small crew? Try these couples drinking games or wedding party games twists:

- **Prediction Sips:** Before kickoff, each person predicts the final score. For every goal you miss, take a drink.
- **Love the Game:** If your partner’s team scores, you both take a drink and share a dare.

And if your Champions League Final is also a bachelor/bachelorette or wedding pre-party, blend in wedding party games by adding custom dares tied to the happy couple or soon-to-be-wed.
