Divide into two teams: Afghanistan (AFG) and Bangladesh (BAN). If your crew’s uneven, let the coin of destiny decide.

**During the match:**  
Every time one of the following happens, drink up:

- **Wicket falls:** The opposing team takes a shot.

- **Boundary (Four):** Only BAN fans drink for AFG boundaries and vice versa.
- **Player celebrates with a dance/meme move:** Spin the Dare Wheel or pull a meme dare from your custom pack.
- **Funny commentary or meme moment:** Last person to react does a dare challenge.
- **Dropped catch or missed run-out:** Whole room drinks.

**NSFW Option:**  
Add in some spicy NSFW dares for those who want to crank up the heat, perfect for couples drinking games or wild house party ideas.
