Ready for an epic reason to gather your crew, break out the dare challenges, and turn meme drinking games into a highlight of your summer? Juneteenth is coming up fast—and in 2025, it falls on **Thursday, June 19**. Whether you’re in the US, UK, Canada, Australia, or Denmark, that’s your cue to spark up some unforgettable party drinking games and celebrate freedom, joy, and togetherness with a twist.

## What Is Juneteenth and Why Celebrate?

Juneteenth marks the day in 1865 when enslaved people in Texas finally learned they were free—two years after the Emancipation Proclamation. It’s a celebration of freedom, community, and resilience. And it’s also the perfect excuse for a house party packed with viral drinking games, custom dare challenges, and meme-fueled fun.

## Juneteenth Drinking Game: Freedom Fest Edition

Bring your friends together, grab your favorite drinks, and get ready for a wild ride with this Juneteenth-inspired drinking game. It’s the ideal way to turn a meaningful day into a legendary night.

### What You’ll Need

- A deck of cards (or a custom drinking game builder—[check ours out!](https://drinkingdojo.com))
- Drinks of your choice (alcoholic or not—your party, your rules)
- A list of dare challenges (from safe to NSFW dares, depending on your vibe)
- Meme cards or a phone for meme prompts
- A speaker for music (bonus points for a freedom-themed playlist)
- Optional: Red, black, and green decorations to set the mood

### How to Play

#### Setup

1. **Shuffle the Deck**: If you’re using regular cards, assign a rule or dare to each card (use our custom drinking game builder for the ultimate personalized experience).
2. **Deal the Fun**: Everyone draws a card on their turn—the card decides what happens next.
3. **Dare Challenges**: Mix in Juneteenth-themed dares like “Give a toast to freedom—if it makes people laugh, give out three drinks,” or “Share a meme about liberation, loser drinks.”

#### Rules

- **Ace**: Make a rule (e.g., no first names—break it, take a drink).
- **King**: Group dare—everybody takes on a meme challenge together.
- **Queen**: Trivia time—get a Juneteenth fact right or sip.
- **Jack**: Dare challenge—pick from the NSFW dares pile if you’re brave.
- **Numbers**: Odd numbers mean you drink, even numbers mean you give drinks.

#### Bonus Rounds

- **Meme Drinking Game**: Pull up a viral meme on your phone. If it’s party-approved, nominate someone to drink. If not, you drink.
- **Couples Drinking Game**: If you’re partying with your partner, take turns giving each other Juneteenth-inspired dares or heartfelt toasts.
