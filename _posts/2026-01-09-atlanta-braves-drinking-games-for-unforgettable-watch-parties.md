Ready to turn your next Atlanta Braves game into a legendary house party? Grab your squad, stock up on drinks, and get ready for the ultimate lineup of party drinking games and dare challenges—custom-built for baseball fans who love a little mayhem with their innings. Whether you’re cranking up the meme drinking games or mixing in some spicy NSFW dares for adults, here’s how to knock your next Braves viewing party out of the park.

## Why Atlanta Braves Drinking Games Are a Home Run

Let’s be honest—there’s nothing better than combining baseball, friends, and just the right amount of chaos. Atlanta Braves drinking games bring everyone together, whether you’re pregaming in a dorm, vibing on a rooftop in London, or hosting a wedding rager in Sydney. Plus, with custom drinking game builder tools, you can make every inning unforgettable (and maybe a little wild).

## What You’ll Need

- Drinks of choice (beer, cocktails, or a sober option for the legends)  
- Atlanta Braves game (stream, TV, or radio)  
- Cups or shot glasses  
- Dare cards or a custom deck from Drinking Dojo  
- Your best Braves spirit (jerseys, caps, foam tomahawks optional)  

## Easy Atlanta Braves Drinking Game Rules

We’ve got two viral drinking games for you—one classic, one meme-worthy. Mix and match or make your own with our [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com).

### 1. The Seventh Inning Sip

**How to Play:**  
- Every time the Braves score a run, everyone takes a sip.  
- If the Braves hit a home run, it’s a shot for the whole crew.  
- When the mascot appears on screen, last person to yell “Braves!” does a dare challenge.  
- If there’s a pitching change, everyone switches seats (and drinks from the new seat’s cup).  
- Seventh inning stretch? Time for a group toast and one of the NSFW dares (if you’re feeling brave).  

### 2. Braves Meme Drinking Challenge

**How to Play:**  
- Print or pull up your favorite Braves memes.  
- Each inning, a different player presents a meme and makes up a quick dare challenge—think “do your best mascot dance” or “talk only in baseball puns for five minutes.”  
- If the Braves are losing by three or more runs, everyone does a group selfie and posts it tagged #BravesParty.  
- At the end of the game, vote for the funniest meme—loser takes a wild card dare.  

## Pro Tips For House Party Ideas

- Mix in couples drinking games if you’ve got pairs—think sharing dares or tag-team challenges.  
- For big events (like a wedding party or Inauguration Day), turn it into a tournament and keep score.  
- Use our [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) to create your own Atlanta Braves party drinking games with local memes, NSFW dares, or even a Fortnite drinking game between innings.
