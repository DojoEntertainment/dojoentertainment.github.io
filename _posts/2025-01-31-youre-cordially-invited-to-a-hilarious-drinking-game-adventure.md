title: You're Cordially Invited to a Hilarious Drinking Game Adventure
---


Welcome to the ultimate party experience where laughter and libations go hand in hand. Inspired by the concept of "You're Cordially Invited" this drinking game promises an evening full of fun friendship and a touch of friendly mischief. Ready to get started

## What You'll Need

To ensure your night is a success gather the following materials:

- A group of enthusiastic friends ideally 4-8 players
- A table or comfortable seating area
- Plenty of your favorite beverages (alcoholic or non-alcoholic)
- A deck of cards
- A bowl for dares and challenges
- Pen and paper for keeping score or jotting down memorable moments

## How to Play

The game is centered around the idea of an imaginary dinner party. Each player takes turns being the host while others are the invited guests. The host's goal is to entertain the guests with a series of fun challenges and questions. Here's how to play

### Step 1: Set the Scene

1. Choose a host randomly to start the game.
2. The host welcomes everyone to their imaginary dinner party and sets the theme (e.g. a masquerade ball beach party or 80s disco).
3. Players take turns drawing cards from the deck.

### Step 2: Card Challenges

Each card represents a different challenge or question:

- **Number Cards (2-10):** The player must answer a question related to the dinner party theme. For example If the theme is a beach party the question might be What's your favorite beach memory

- **Face Cards (J Q K):** These cards trigger a group activity. The player must choose a challenge from the bowl for everyone to complete. Examples include a group dance-off or singing a song together.

- **Aces:** The player who draws an Ace can make a house rule for the rest of the round. Be creative but not too cruel

### Step 3: Special Challenges

For an extra layer of fun add special challenges inspired by classic games. Spice things up with a round of [Truth or Dare](https://drinkingdojo.com/games/truth-or-dare) whenever a Joker card is drawn. This keeps the energy high and the laughter rolling.

### Step 4: End of Round

After everyone has drawn a card and completed a challenge the round ends. The host role rotates clockwise and the next host sets a new theme. Continue playing until you're ready to crown a party king or queen based on who entertained the most or completed the funniest challenges.

## Tips for an Unforgettable Night

- Encourage creativity and silliness.
- Remember to drink responsibly and know your limits.
- Take photos or videos to capture the fun and share them with friends later.

So gather your pals and get ready for a night of endless entertainment with the "You're Cordially Invited" drinking game. It's the perfect way to break the ice make new memories and enjoy each other's company. Cheers to an unforgettable party
