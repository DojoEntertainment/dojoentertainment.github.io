## Emergency Meeting: This Drinking Game is Definitely Sus

We’ve all felt the rush. The frantic swiping of the admin card. The desperate attempt to fix the lights while a potential murderer lurks just out of sight. The sheer, unadulterated chaos of an emergency meeting where everyone is yelling, "WHERE?"

_Among Us_ isn't just a game; it's a masterclass in deception, paranoia, and hilarious social deduction. It has created countless moments of masterful lies and friendship-testing accusations. But what if you could raise the stakes? What if every task, every kill, and every vote had a real-time consequence?

Get ready to make your lobby even more unpredictable. It's time to call an emergency meeting for the **[Among Us Drinking Game](https://drinkingdojo.com/articles/among-us)**.

### The Perfect Formula for Paranoia

The genius of _Among Us_ is in its social dynamics. The tension between trust and suspicion is what makes every round a unique story. A drinking game doesn't just add to this—it amplifies it.

Imagine trying to defend yourself as the Impostor while a few sips make it just a little harder to lie convincingly. Or as a Crewmate, every time you get voted out incorrectly, your friends have to drink to their failure. It transforms the entire experience.

Suddenly, getting killed first isn't so bad when you can sit back and watch the chaos unfold. Successfully faking a task as the Impostor feels even more brilliant. It's the ultimate way to turn the game's natural paranoia into a full-blown party, where every action has an immediate, fun-filled consequence.

### The Rules of Deception

We’ve created the perfect set of rules to bring this chaotic idea to life. The game is simple: specific events that happen on the Skeld, Polus, or MIRA HQ are now tied to drinking actions.

- Did you get killed by an Impostor? There's a rule for that.
- Called an emergency meeting for a false accusation? Time to drink.
- Did the Crewmates successfully vote out an Impostor? A celebratory sip is in order.
- Did the Impostors win by sabotage? Victory has never tasted so sweet.

The rules are designed to be fair for both Crewmates and Impostors, ensuring the fun stays balanced no matter what role you get.
