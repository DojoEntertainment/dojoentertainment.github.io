Ready to turn your next hangout into a legendary night? Whether you’re vibing with your crew or planning a wild house party, we’ve got a brand-new way to get everyone laughing, scheming, and maybe even spilling some secrets. Based on the viral trend of matching connections, “Connections Hint June 3” is your ticket to unforgettable dares, hilarious memes, and drinking challenges that bring everyone together. Let’s break down how to play, what you’ll need, and why this is about to be your new favorite in the dojo of drinking games!

## What Is the Connections Hint June 3 Drinking Game?

Inspired by party drinking games and the always-popular meme drinking games, this one’s all about spotting connections among your friends—and calling them out with custom dares and sips. It’s flexible, easy to learn, and guaranteed to get everyone in on the action. Think of it as a mashup between classic house party ideas and the best viral drinking games you’ve seen online.

## What You’ll Need

- **A group of friends (3+ players)**
- **Drinks of choice** (beer, cocktails, mocktails—whatever fits your vibe)
- **Notecards or sticky notes**
- **Pens or markers**
- **A timer (phone works perfectly)**
- Optional: **Your phone for meme references or custom drinking game builder tools from [Drinking Dojo](https://drinkingdojo.com)**

## How To Play Connections Hint June 3

### 1. Set Up the Game

- Hand out notecards and pens to everyone.
- Each player writes down a secret connection between 3-5 people in the group. (For example: “These people have all done a Fortnite dance at a party,” or “These three always order tequila shots.”)
- Shuffle the notecards and place them face down.

### 2. The Round Begins

- The first player picks a card and reads ONLY the names aloud.
- The rest of the group has 60 seconds to guess the connection.
- If someone guesses right, the group who’s named takes a drink (or does a dare challenge)! If no one gets it, the reader makes up a custom dare for everyone on the card.

### 3. Add the Dare Challenge Twist

- Every wrong guess means the guesser takes a sip.
- If a player is named on three different cards in a row, they have to draw an NSFW dare from the “Dare Deck” (or use our custom drinking game builder to create one on the spot).

### 4. Keep It Going

- Rotate the reader each round.
- Throw in bonus rounds: “Wedding Party Games” (connections about couples or wedding stories), “Election Day Drinking Game” (political moments), or even “Fortnite Drinking Game” for the gamers in the group.

## Pro Tips for Maximum Mayhem

- Mix in meme references for extra laughs.
- Use inside jokes and wild dares to keep things spicy.
- Perfect for couples drinking games or big house parties—just increase the number of cards per round!

## Why You’ll Love It

This is the ultimate excuse to spill the tea, flex your memory, and keep the drinks flowing. It’s totally customizable, works for any group size, and pairs perfectly with any of your favorite party drinking games.
