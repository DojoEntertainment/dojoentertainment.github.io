---

In this age of digital connectivity, hanging out with friends online has become a norm. To spice up your virtual gatherings, why not try some drinking games? Here are five of the best drinking games to play online with friends.

### 1. Truth or Dare

A classic game that never gets old, Truth or Dare is perfect for virtual hangouts. The rules are simple: players take turns choosing between answering a truth question or performing a dare. Online tools like Truth or Dare generators can make the game flow smoothly, and video calls ensure everyone can witness the dares being carried out. It's a great way to reveal secrets and get everyone laughing (or cringing).

**How to Play:**

-   Go to [Drinking Dojo Truth or Dare](https://drinkingdojo.com/games/truth-or-dare)
-   Take turns asking the player to choose "Truth" or "Dare."
-   If they refuse to answer or complete the dare, they take a drink.

### 2. Most Likely To

This game is all about fun accusations and getting to know your friends better. Players take turns asking "Most Likely To" questions, like "Who is most likely to get lost in their own neighborhood?" Everyone points to who they think fits the bill, and the person with the most votes takes a drink.

**How to Play:**

-   Go to [Drinking Dojo Most Likely To](https://drinkingdojo.com/games/most-likely-to)
-   Take turns reading a question.
-   On the count of three, everyone points to the person they think the statement applies to.
-   The person with the most votes drinks.

### 3. Never Have I Ever

A game of revelations and surprises, Never Have I Ever can quickly escalate into a hilarious session. Players take turns saying something they have never done, starting with "Never have I ever...". If anyone has done it, they take a drink. It's a fantastic way to discover unexpected facts about your friends.

**How to Play:**

-   Go to [Drinking Dojo Never Have I Ever](https://drinkingdojo.com/games/never-have-i-ever)
-   Each player takes turns stating something they’ve never done.
-   Anyone who has done it must drink.
-   Continue until everyone is tipsy and more open to sharing.

### 4. Meyer

Meyer, also known as Mia, is a dice game that involves bluffing and keen observation. Each player rolls two dice and keeps their result secret, then announces their roll (which can be a bluff). The next player decides whether to believe it or not. If they call the bluff correctly, the liar drinks; if they’re wrong, they drink.

**How to Play:**

-   Roll two dice and look at the result without showing others.
-   Announce your roll truthfully or bluff.
-   The next player decides to call the bluff or believe it.
-   If they call correctly, the liar drinks; if not, they drink.

### 5. Drunk Dice

Drunk Dice is a simple yet unpredictable game. Each number on the die corresponds to a different action or rule. Players take turns rolling the die and follow the rule associated with the number they roll. It's a game of chance that can lead to some unexpected and hilarious outcomes.

**How to Play:**

-   Assign a rule to each number on a six-sided die (e.g., 1: Take a sip, 2: Nominate someone to drink, 3: Everyone drinks, etc.).
-   Players take turns rolling the die and performing the corresponding action.
-   Continue until everyone is cheerfully tipsy.
