Ever find yourself stuck inside with friends when the weather’s a little extra wild? Don’t just track the storm—track your drinks instead. The Hurricane Tracker is the ultimate drinking game for parties, house hangouts, or any night when you want your crew to ride out the chaos together. Get ready for viral drinking games, dare challenges, and meme-level memories.

## What Is Hurricane Tracker?

Hurricane Tracker is a high-energy party drinking game where you and your friends turn storm watching into a hilarious, unforgettable drinking challenge. It's perfect for house parties, pregames, or even wedding party games where you want to add a bit of playful mayhem. No actual hurricane required—just a sense of adventure and a stash of your favorite drinks.

## What You Need

- **A weather app** (or a live storm tracker online)
- Your favorite drinks (beer, cocktails, or mocktails—dealer’s choice)
- Dare cards or a [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) to spice things up
- Friends ready to brave the storm

## How To Play Hurricane Tracker

### 1. Set Up Your Watch Party

Gather everyone in the living room with your drinks and open your weather app or put the live storm tracker on the TV. If you’re feeling extra, decorate the room with storm-themed props—umbrellas, raincoats, anything goes.

### 2. Assign Roles

- **Meteorologist**: This person checks the tracker and calls out alerts.
- **Storm Chasers**: Everyone else! They react to the meteorologist’s calls with drinks and dares.

### 3. The Rules

Every time something happens on the hurricane tracker, you drink or do a dare. Here’s a classic set of rules to get started:

- **New Storm Warning:** Everyone takes a drink
- **Storm Upgraded (e.g. Category 1 to 2):** Last person to touch their head does a dare challenge
- **Storm Downgraded:** Give out two drinks to anyone you choose
- **Wind Speed Hits a Multiple of 10**: Everyone sips
- **Rainfall Update:** Meteorologist makes up a meme drinking game dare (bonus points for NSFW dares if you’re in the right crowd)
- **Broadcast Interrupts:** All players must switch seats, and the last one to sit takes two drinks

### 4. Add Your Own Twists

Challenge your mates with wild, viral drinking games—think Fortnite drinking game moves (build a fort out of cushions, anyone?) or couples drinking games for a more intimate stormy night.

### 5. Keep It Safe

Know your limits, check in on your friends, and remember: the only thing you should be chasing is good vibes, not actual storms.
