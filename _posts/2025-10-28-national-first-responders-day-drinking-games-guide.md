It’s National First Responders Day—a moment to raise a glass for the heroes who always show up. Whether you’re chilling with friends, organizing a house party, or just looking for an excuse to try new party drinking games, we’ve got you covered. Drinking Dojo is all about turning good times into legendary ones, and today, we’re bringing you the ultimate drinking games and dare challenges inspired by the real MVPs: first responders.

## Why Celebrate With Drinking Games?

First responders deserve recognition, and what better way to celebrate their courage (and your squad’s ability to handle wild dares) than with some unforgettable drinking challenges? Whether you want to play viral drinking games that get everyone talking, or you’re after a custom drinking game builder for your party, honoring the day can be fun and meaningful—just don’t forget to toast the heroes!

## First Responders Relay: The Ultimate Party Drinking Game

Ready to put your reflexes to the test? This game is perfect for house parties, wedding party games, or even a couples drinking games night if you’re feeling competitive. It’s also a great way to break the ice and crank up the energy.

### Materials Needed

- Deck of cards  
- Two dice  
- Drinks for everyone  
- Dare challenge cards (make your own or grab some from [Drinking Dojo](https://drinkingdojo.com))  
- Timer or stopwatch  

### How To Play

1. **Form Your Squad:**  
   Split into two teams—Fire and Rescue. (Or get creative with names like Paramedics vs. Lifeguards.)

2. **Card Call:**  
   Put the deck in the middle. Each team takes turns drawing a card. Each suit = a different challenge:
   - **Hearts:** Drink for 2 seconds and share a first responder meme.
   - **Spades:** Roll the dice. Odd = take a dare challenge from the stack; Even = nominate someone else.
   - **Diamonds:** Quick-fire trivia—name something a first responder uses. Fail? Drink!
   - **Clubs:** Group challenge. Everyone drinks, last to finish does an NSFW dare (if you’re feeling spicy).

3. **Dare Dispatch:**  
   Every time a Joker is drawn, both teams face off in a viral drinking game—think Fortnite drinking game (if you’re fans) or a quick round of the custom drinking game builder from Drinking Dojo.

4. **Rescue Round:**  
   Every 10 minutes, set a timer for a “Rescue Mission.” Both teams race to complete a dare challenge. Losers drink, winners get bragging rights.

5. **Winning the Game:**  
   After the deck runs out or everyone’s had enough, whichever team completed the most dare challenges (without chickening out) wins. Losers buy the next round.

## Tips for the Best National First Responders Day Party

- **Get Creative With Dares:** Mix in meme drinking games or make the dares about real-life heroics (“Imitate a firefighter for 10 seconds”).
- **Keep It Safe:** First responders are all about safety, so pace yourself and check in with your crew.
- **Share Your Moments:** Snap pics or memes and tag your party—let’s make those viral drinking games legendary!
