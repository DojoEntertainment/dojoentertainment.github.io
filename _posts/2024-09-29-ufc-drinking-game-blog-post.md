Invite your friends over and explain the rules of the game. Make sure everyone has their drinks ready.

### Step 3: Understand the Rules
The rules are easy to follow but can get intense as the night goes on. Here’s how it works:

#### Pre-Fight Rules
1. **Introduction Drinks**: When Bruce Buffer announces the fighters, take a sip.
2. **Tale of the Tape**: When the tale of the tape is shown, take a sip.
3. **Walkout Music**: If you recognize the fighter's walkout music, take a sip.

#### In-Fight Rules
1. **Significant Strike**: Every time a significant strike lands, take a sip.
2. **Takedown**: If a fighter gets a takedown, everyone takes a gulp.
3. **Submission Attempt**: Every submission attempt, take a sip.
4. **Knockdown**: If a fighter gets knocked down, take a shot.
5. **Round End**: At the end of each round, everyone takes a sip.

#### Post-Fight Rules
1. **Decision**: If the fight goes to a decision, take a gulp.
2. **Knockout**: If the fight ends in a knockout, everyone takes a shot.
3. **Post-Fight Interview**: If the fighter calls out someone in the post-fight interview, take a sip.

### Step 4: Enjoy the Fight
