When you think of Denver, you probably picture mountains, craft beers, and—let’s be real—some of the wildest weather swings ever. One minute it’s sunny, and the next, you’re getting pelted with hail the size of golf balls. But here at Drinking Dojo, we’re turning those unpredictable Denver skies into your next legendary party drinking game. Ready to ride the weather rollercoaster with your crew? Let’s make Denver’s forecast the life of your next house party!

## Why Denver Weather Makes the Ultimate Party Drinking Game

Denver’s weather is basically the ultimate meme—snow in the morning, sun in the afternoon, hail at dinner. So why not celebrate (or survive) it with a custom drinking game that throws you curveballs, just like the Mile High City’s forecast? Whether you’re planning house party ideas, wedding party games, or just vibing with friends, this drinking challenge is perfect for anyone looking for unforgettable, viral drinking games.

## How To Play Denver Weather Drinking Games

### What You’ll Need

- Your favorite drinks (beer, cocktails, mocktails—dealer’s choice)
- A phone or smart TV with live access to a Denver weather app or local news
- A deck of cards (optional, but adds an extra twist)
- Dare challenges or meme drinking games packs from [Drinking Dojo](https://drinkingdojo.com)
- At least three friends (the more, the wilder)

### Setting Up

1. **Tune In**: Pull up a live Denver weather forecast or set up weather notifications on your phone.
2. **Pick Your Game Mode**: You can go classic (“drink when X happens”) or use our custom drinking game builder to add wild dares, meme challenges, and NSFW dares for late-night vibes.

### The Basic Rules

#### Drink On The Forecast

- **Temperature Drop**: Every time the temperature drops by 2°F (or 1°C), everyone takes a sip. If it jumps back up, reverse it and make everyone give out a drink.
- **Weather Change**: New weather alert? Chug for 5 seconds. (Rain to snow, snow to sun, etc.)
- **Wind Gusts**: If the forecast mentions “gusty winds,” the last person to blow on their drink takes a dare challenge.
- **Sun Icon Appears**: When the sun pops up, toast to summer and everyone drinks together.

#### Bonus Round: Card Deck Chaos

Add a deck of cards for some meme drinking game energy:
- **Red Cards**: Draw a dare from your Drinking Dojo dare pack.
- **Black Cards**: Give out drinks to anyone still wearing socks (Denver is cold, we get it).

#### NSFW Weather

Playing after hours? Make it spicy with NSFW dares tied to weather events—hailstorm means the group’s wildest dare challenge, or thunderstorm triggers a round of truth or dare.

## Customizing Your Denver Weather Drinking Game

Want to make it even more viral? Use our [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) to add local memes, couples drinking games, or Fortnite drinking game twists. The more personal, the better—shout out to those who’ve survived a Denver snowstorm in flip-flops.

## Perfect For Any Occasion

- **Wedding party games**: Break the ice with unexpected weather fun.
- **House party ideas**: Keep the energy up, rain or shine.
- **Couples drinking games**: Up the romance or the rivalry when the weather turns wild.
