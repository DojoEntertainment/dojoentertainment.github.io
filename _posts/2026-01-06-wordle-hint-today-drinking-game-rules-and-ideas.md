Looking for a way to supercharge your next hangout or house party? If you and your friends can’t stop sharing today’s Wordle hint, we’ve got the perfect party drinking game to turn those guesses into unforgettable laughs (and maybe a few dares too). Welcome to the ultimate Wordle Hint Today Drinking Game — where your brain, your luck, and your liver get put to the test.

## What You Need

- A group of 2 or more players (the more, the merrier)  
- Phones or a shared screen for playing Wordle  
- Your favorite drinks (beer, cider, cocktails, or non-alcoholic alternatives)  
- Dare cards or access to [Drinking Dojo’s custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) for extra spicy challenges  

## How To Play The Wordle Hint Today Drinking Game

### 1. Set Up The Game  
Gather everyone and decide if you’ll use the official Wordle or a meme version (bonus points if you play a Fortnite drinking game or wedding party games in the same night). Pick someone to be the scribe who’ll type in the guesses.

### 2. Guessing Rounds  
- Each player takes turns suggesting a word to guess.  
- For each round, the group discusses possible guesses based on the Wordle hint today.

### 3. Assigning Drinks  

Add some viral drinking games magic by using these rules:  
- **Wrong Letter**: For every letter in your guess that isn’t in the answer, take a sip.  
- **Yellow (Right Letter, Wrong Spot)**: Assign a sip to another player.  
- **Green (Right Letter, Right Spot)**: Celebrate and make someone else take a drink.  
- **Out of Guesses**: If the group runs out of guesses before getting the answer, everyone does a dare or takes a shot.

### 4. Dare Challenges And Meme Drinking Games  

Spice up the party with dare challenges after each round. Use Drinking Dojo’s custom drinking game builder to add NSFW dares, viral meme challenges, or even a Fortnite drinking game twist for the losers (Dance emote, anyone?). For couples drinking games, losers could swap dares or answer personal questions.

## House Rules And Party Ideas

- **Wedding Party Games:** Play as teams (bride’s side vs. groom’s side) with wedding-themed dares.  
- **Election Day Drinking Game:** Use political words and add a sip for every debate or campaign meme.  
- **Inauguration Day Drinking Game:** Celebrate with themed drinks for every presidential word guessed.
