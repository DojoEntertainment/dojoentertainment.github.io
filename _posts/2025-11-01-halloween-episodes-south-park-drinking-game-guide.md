## Drinking Game Rules for South Park Halloween Episodes

Ready to get started? Here’s a classic Drinking Dojo setup for a viral drinking game night:

### Take a Sip When:

- Someone says “Oh my God” or “Dude”
- Cartman hatches a new scheme
- Anyone wears a ridiculous costume

- The episode breaks the fourth wall
- You laugh so hard you snort (be honest!)
