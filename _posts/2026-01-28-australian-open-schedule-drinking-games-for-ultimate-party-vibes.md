## Why Make Tennis Nights Legendary?

The Australian Open isn’t just about tennis—it’s about energy, excitement, and epic wins. So, why not serve up some meme drinking games and dare challenges alongside every match? From the first serve to the final set, every moment is a chance to spice up your house party or chill hangout.

## How To Play: Australian Open Drinking Game Rules

Ready to smash your next party? Here’s a set of easy, viral drinking games to play along with the Australian Open schedule:

### Basic Serve: Classic Sips

- **Every ace:** Everyone takes a sip.  
- **Double fault:** Last person to touch their nose drinks.  
- **Player challenge:** If a player requests a review, everyone votes if it’s in or out—wrong voters drink.  
- **Break point:** Everyone does a dare challenge (think NSFW dares or something from the Drinking Dojo meme pack).  
- **Game set match:** When your chosen player wins a set, give out three sips to anyone.  

### Meme Match: Add The Banter

- **Commentator cliché:** If someone says “unbelievable” or “incredible,” everyone drinks.  
- **Player tantrum:** When a player smashes a racket, group dare challenge—winner skips their next drink.  
- **Epic rally:** For rallies over 20 hits, everyone finishes their drink or pulls a wild card dare.  

### Customise It: Make Your Own Rules

Use the custom drinking game builder from Drinking Dojo to mix in your own viral drinking games, NSFW dares, or even spice things up with wedding party games or couples drinking games if you’re feeling cheeky.
