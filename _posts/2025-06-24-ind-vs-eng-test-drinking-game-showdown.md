The cricket rivalry gets wild when you add drinks, dares, and a touch of mayhem. Grab your favorite beverages and let’s turn every run, wicket, and meme-worthy moment into a memory.

## What You Need

- A group of friends (the more, the better)
- Drinks of your choice (beer, cocktails, shots — you do you)
- A TV or streaming device for the Ind vs Eng test
- Dare cards (optional: create your own or use [Drinking Dojo’s custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) for endless ideas)

## Basic Rules

**The goal:** Celebrate every twist and turn in the Ind vs Eng test with drinks, dares, and epic party vibes. This is one of those **viral drinking games** you’ll want to play again and again.

### Set Up

1. Split into two teams: Team India and Team England (feel free to pick your favorite, or assign randomly).
2. Pick your drink of choice and get comfy — you’ll be here for a while!
3. Decide on your dare challenges: Classic dares, **NSFW dares**, **meme drinking games**, or a mix.

### Gameplay

Whenever something from the list below happens, follow the **party drinking game** prompt. If you’re feeling wild, add a house rule or two — this is the dojo of drinking games, after all.

#### Drink Prompts

- **Every boundary (4 or 6):** Everyone on the batting team drinks.
- **Wicket falls:** Fielding team celebrates with a drink.
- **Player scores a half-century:** All players on the same team toast and finish their drink.
- **Dropped catch or missed run-out:** Everyone takes a sip and does a **dare challenge**.
- **DRS (Decision Review System) used:** The captain of each team guesses the outcome. Wrong guess? Finish your drink!
- **Legendary meme moment (funny commentator quote, wild fan in the crowd, bizarre replay):** Shout “Dojo!” and the last person drinks.

#### Dare Challenges

Want to spice it up? Throw in dare cards like:

- Speak in a British or Indian accent for one over.
