At Drinking Dojo, we’re all about bending rules and turning moments into unforgettable parties. So grab your crew, stock your fridge, and prep those controllers. Here’s your ultimate guide to GTA 6 release date party drinking games, featuring wild dare challenges, meme-worthy moments, and tips on custom party game setups.

## Why Throw a GTA 6 Release Date Party?

Let’s be real: the GTA 6 release date is basically a global holiday for gamers. Whether you’re playing with friends across the US, UK, Canada, Australia, or Denmark, this is your excuse to go big. Think house party ideas with a twist — wild drinking challenges, NSFW dares (if you’re feeling bold), and enough laughs to keep your campaign going until sunrise.

## What You’ll Need

- A copy of GTA 6 (duh)
- Consoles, controllers, and a TV big enough for the action
- Your favorite drinks (beer, cocktails, soda — you do you)
- Shot glasses or cups
- Dare cards or a custom drinking game builder ([check ours out!](https://drinkingdojo.com))
- Snacks, because you’ll need fuel

## GTA 6 Release Date Drinking Game Rules

Ready to turn your GTA 6 launch night into a meme drinking game for the ages? Here are our favorite rules you can mix, match, and customize.

### Basic Rules

- **Die in-game:** Take a drink.
- **Get a wanted level:** Take a drink for every star.
- **Complete a mission:** Pick someone to do a dare challenge.
- **Crash your car:** Everyone yells “WASTED!” and the last to do so drinks.
- **Accidentally run over a pedestrian:** Take two drinks and apologize (bonus: do it in your best GTA accent).

### Dare Challenges

Spice things up with viral drinking games and dares:

- **Perform a stunt jump:** If you land it, assign a drink. If you fail, do a dare.
- **Steal a car without getting caught:** Everyone bets on your success. If you fail, take drinks equal to the number of failed attempts.
- **Visit a strip club in-game:** Do an NSFW dare (keep it safe and consensual, folks).
- **Get five stars:** Everyone else drinks until you lose the cops.

### Meme Drinking Games

Because GTA is basically a meme generator:

- **NPC says something ridiculous:** Everyone drinks and repeats it in their best impression.
- **Glitch happens:** The person who spots it first assigns a dare.
- **Reference to old GTA games:** Everybody takes a shot for nostalgia.
