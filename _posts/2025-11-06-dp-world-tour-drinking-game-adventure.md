### How To Play the DP World Tour Drinking Game

Ready to tee off? Here’s how to turn every swing, putt, and celebration into a reason to raise your glass.

#### Basic Rules

1. **Pick Your Players:** Everyone grabs a seat and a drink.  
2. **Assign Golfers or Teams:** Each person (or group) picks a golfer or country to follow for the round.  
3. **Drink When…**  
   - Your golfer birdies: Take two sips.  
   - Your golfer bogeys: Finish your drink.  
   - There’s a hole-in-one: Everyone in the room does a dare challenge.  
   - A commentator says “pressure” or “underdog”: Last person to raise their glass takes a shot.  
   - A golfer misses a short putt: Everyone groans, then drinks.  
   - There’s a crowd roar: Pass your drink to the left.  
4. **Special Dare Challenges:** At the end of every 3rd hole, draw a dare from the meme drinking games pile—think NSFW dares, viral TikTok trends, or Fortnite drinking game moves.
