Ready for epic Champions League nights with a twist? Whether you’re cheering for your favorite team or just vibing with friends, nothing turns a match into a party quite like drinking games. At Drinking Dojo, we’ve mastered the art of mixing party drinking games, dare challenges, and viral meme magic—so your Champions League experience goes way beyond the final whistle.

Let’s break down how to host the ultimate Champions League watch party and keep the spirits high (literally).

## The Ultimate Champions League Drinking Game

Watching the match at your place, a mate’s flat, or even in a packed pub? Bring out a drinking game that’ll have everyone invested, no matter the score.

### What You’ll Need

- Your favorite drinks (beer, cocktails, or mocktails—pick your vibe)
- TV, laptop, or projector streaming the Champions League
- Group of friends (the more the merrier)
- Scorecards (optional, but extra fun)
- Drinking Dojo’s [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) for extra spice

### How To Play: Champions League Edition

**Pick Your Poison:**  
Choose your drink—go classic with beer, mix up cocktails, or play it safe with mocktails. Just make sure everyone’s got a full glass before kickoff.

**Set The Rules:**  
Here’s a viral drinking game format you can adapt for any Champions League match:

- **Take a sip if:**  
  - The commentator says “unbelievable”
  - Someone flops dramatically
  - There’s a throw-in within the first five minutes

- **Take two sips if:**  
  - Your team scores  
  - The ref gives a yellow card  
  - Someone misses an open goal

- **Dare challenges:**  
  - Missed penalty? The whole group does an NSFW dare (keep it friendly—nobody wants to get banned from the living room)
  - Any goal in extra time = meme drinking game round. Each person sends a football meme in the group chat—best meme picks who drinks next.

- **Finish your drink if:**  
  - The match ends in a penalty shootout  
  - Your team wins (or loses, if you’re a good sport)

Mix in custom dares or create your own rules using Drinking Dojo’s custom drinking game builder for endless options.

## House Party Ideas For Champions League Nights

Take your Champions League party up a notch with these house party ideas:

- **Theme Nights:** Dress up as players, referees, or your favorite meme (bonus points for viral drinking games with themed dares).
- **Couples Drinking Games:** Make it interesting with “predict the next scorer”—loser does a dare challenge together.
- **Wedding Party Games:** Got a wedding afterparty during the match? Adapt the rules for newlyweds and guests for a legendary night.

## Champions League, But Make It Unforgettable

There’s nothing like the roar of the crowd, the thrill of a last-minute goal, and the chaos of a perfectly executed drinking game. Whether you’re planning an inauguration day drinking game, a Fortnite drinking game for halftime, or just want new drinking challenges, Drinking Dojo has you covered.
