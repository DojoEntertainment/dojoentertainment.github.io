Whether you’re binging her best shows, vibing with friends, or just hunting for unique party drinking games, these ideas are packed with dare challenges, meme-worthy moments, and pure mayhem. Grab your crew, your favorite drinks, and let’s get this party started!

## What You’ll Need

- A streaming device (Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc.)
- Any Betty Gilpin show or movie (think GLOW, The Hunt, or Mrs. Davis)
- Your favorite drinks (beer, cocktails, or mocktails—whatever your dojo prefers)
- Shot glasses or cups for each player
- Dare cards (optional, but highly recommended for extra chaos)
- A sense of humor and a love of viral drinking games

## How To Play The Betty Gilpin Drinking Game

1. **Pick Your Betty Gilpin Flick:**  
   Choose a movie or series featuring Betty Gilpin. GLOW is a top pick for meme drinking games, but any of her projects work.

2. **Set Up The Rules:**  
   Each time one of the following happens on screen, everyone takes a sip (or a shot, if you’re feeling bold):

   - Betty Gilpin delivers a savage comeback
   - There’s an epic fight scene
   - Someone says “wrestling” or mentions the ring (GLOW fans, you know!)
   - Betty’s character breaks the rules
   - A meme-worthy moment goes down (bonus points for viral scenes)

3. **Dare Challenges:**  
   At random intervals (set a timer or use a custom drinking game builder), the person with the emptiest cup must draw a dare card. Example NSFW dares (if your group’s up for it):

   - Post a Betty Gilpin meme on your story
   - Do your best wrestling pose in the living room
   - Let someone else come up with a dare on the spot

4. **Meme Drinking Games Bonus Rounds:**  
   Pause the show at random. First person to shout out a viral moment from Betty’s career gets to hand out three drinks or assign a dare.

5. **Last Call:**  
   When the episode or movie ends, everyone toasts to Betty! The person who laughed the hardest during the game gets to create a new rule for next time.
