Nothing says “cheers” like a day at the races — and Royal Ascot is the perfect excuse to turn up the party drinking games, slay some dare challenges, and make memories you’ll never forget. Whether you’re hosting a rooftop bash, pre-gaming before the main event, or just want an excuse to rock a fancy hat while sipping drinks with friends, these Royal Ascot-inspired drinking games are your ticket to legendary fun.

## What You Need To Play

Get ready to bring the meme drinking games energy! Here’s what you’ll need:
- Your favorite drinks (champagne, beer, cocktails, or non-alcoholic if you prefer)
- A TV or stream showing Royal Ascot races
- Scorecards or notepads for tracking wins and dares
- Fancy hats and dress code (optional, but highly recommended for the experience)
- A pack of cards or access to the [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) if you want to level up the challenge

## How To Play Royal Ascot Drinking Games

Here are the go-to house party ideas for Royal Ascot, guaranteed to give your squad a taste of high society with a wild twist:

### 1. **Race Day Sips**

**Rules:**
- Every time the commentator says “favourite,” everyone takes a sip.
- If a horse’s name makes you laugh out loud, you have to take two drinks.
- Whenever a jockey’s colors match your outfit, you give out a dare challenge to someone else.

**Materials:** Drinks, TV/stream, fancy fits.

### 2. **Hat Trick Dare**

**Rules:**
- Everyone wears a hat (bonus points for outrageous styles).
- If your hat falls off or you touch it during a race, you must draw a dare from a custom pack or create your own using the custom drinking game builder.
- NSFW dares? Only if your group is into that vibe.

**Materials:** Hats, dare cards, drinks.

### 3. **Photo Finish Frenzy**

**Rules:**
- Before each race, everyone picks a horse. If your horse wins, you hand out drinks (one per player). If your horse loses, you take a drink and complete a meme dare.
- The person who picks the last-place horse has to post a silly Royal Ascot meme in your group chat or on social (if they dare!).

**Materials:** Drinks, horses list, meme dares.

### 4. **Royal Cheers Challenge**

**Rules:**
- Anytime a celebrity or royal is spotted on the broadcast, everyone raises their glass and drinks.
- For every royal wave, the last person to mimic the wave takes a drink and does a quick wedding party game dare (think: two truths and a lie, but about Ascot fashion).

**Materials:** Drinks, a sharp eye, dare prompts.
