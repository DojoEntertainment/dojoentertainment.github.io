Game on, party people! College gameday week 4 is here, and that means it’s time to level up your house party ideas, rally your crew, and bring out the wildest party drinking games. Whether you’re pregaming for the big match, vibing in your dorm, or hosting a backyard barbecue, these drinking games and dare challenges will turn any gameday into a legendary bash.

## The Ultimate College Gameday Drinking Game

Ready to add some mayhem and meme-worthy moments to your Saturday? Here’s the perfect party drinking game for college gameday week 4—easy to play, packed with dares, and guaranteed to get everyone hyped (and maybe a bit tipsy).

### What You’ll Need

- Your favorite drinks (beer, seltzers, cocktails—whatever fuels your squad)
- A TV or stream for the game
- Custom dare cards (or use the [Drinking Dojo custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) to make your own)
- Optional: meme props, team gear, ping pong balls

### Game Setup

1. Gather everyone around the screen and split into two teams (one for each college team playing).
2. Each team picks a “captain” for the first round.
3. Stack your drinks nearby and shuffle your dare cards.

### How to Play

1. **Kickoff Toast**  
   Everyone raises a glass (or can) and toasts to their team’s victory. Chug for five seconds if your team is the underdog according to the odds.

2. **Game Event Triggers**  
   Take a sip or complete a dare when these happen:
   - Your team scores: The other team drinks.
   - There’s a touchdown: Everyone does a group dare challenge.
   - Ref makes a controversial call: Both teams send their captains to do a meme drinking game (like “flip cup with a twist”—loser does an NSFW dare).
   - Halftime: Quickfire round of couples drinking games (great for mixing things up and breaking the ice).

3. **Wildcard Dares**  
   Every time a commercial break hits, draw a dare card. These can be as classic or as wild as you want—think “sing your team’s fight song with a mouthful of crackers” or “post your best touchdown dance to your story.”

4. **Meme Drinking Games Bonus**  
   If a viral meme moment happens during the broadcast (like a wild fan costume or awkward sideline interview), shout “DOJO!” Last person to react must do a double dare.

5. **Victory Lap**  
   Whichever team wins the game? The losing side has to perform a mega dare or finish their drinks—no excuses.

### House Rules

- Always play safe and know your limits.
- Swap out dares for non-alcoholic challenges if needed.
- Customize the game with your own local traditions, from the US to the UK, Canada, Australia, or Denmark.

## Extra Gameday Spice
