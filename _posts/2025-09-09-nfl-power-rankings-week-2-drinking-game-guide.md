NFL season is back and so are the epic house parties, wild dares, and meme-worthy moments. Whether you’re tuning in from the US, UK, Canada, Australia, or Denmark, there’s no better way to spice up the games than with a viral drinking game that keeps everyone hyped and engaged. Ready to add some mayhem to your NFL Sundays? Here’s your guide to making NFL Power Rankings Week 2 unforgettable with the ultimate party drinking game.

## Why Turn NFL Power Rankings Into a Drinking Game?

Let’s be honest: half the fun of NFL season is the unpredictability—every week, new teams rise and fall, making the power rankings a rollercoaster. Mix in some drinks, a few dare challenges, and a sprinkle of meme drinking games, and suddenly, every fumble or touchdown is a reason to celebrate (or commiserate).

Whether you’re hosting a big bash, chilling with your crew, or even watching with your partner for some couples drinking games fun, this NFL power rankings week 2 drinking game is your ticket to a wild night.

## What You’ll Need for This Party Drinking Game

- **A TV (or stream) with the NFL games or power rankings coverage**
- **Drinks of choice** (beer, cocktails, seltzers—dealer’s choice)
- **Printed list or digital view of the Week 2 NFL power rankings**
- **Dare cards or the [Custom Drinking Game Builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) for extra spice**
- **Friends ready for some competitive fun**

## NFL Power Rankings Week 2 Drinking Game Rules

Here’s how to play:

### 1. Pick Your Team

- Everyone chooses (or is assigned) an NFL team from the Week 2 power rankings. Double up if you’ve got a big group.

### 2. Rank Jumps and Drops

- **Take 1 sip** every time your team moves up in the rankings.
- **Take 2 sips** if your team drops in the rankings.
- **If your team jumps into the Top 5 or falls out of it, do a dare challenge** (draw from your dare cards or use NSFW dares if your group’s feeling spicy).

### 3. Call the Upset

- Guess which team will have the biggest leap or drop that week. If you’re right, assign 3 sips to anyone. If you’re wrong, you take 3 sips.

### 4. Meme Moment

- Whenever a wild meme-worthy play or moment is shown (think epic fails, weird celebration dances, or classic NFL drama), everyone drinks. The first person to shout “Meme!” can give out an extra dare.

### 5. Underdog Victory

- If the lowest-ranked team wins their game, everyone finishes their drink or completes a dare challenge.

## Extra Drinking Challenges and Dare Challenges

Want to take things up a notch? Throw in some custom dares—think “Fortnite touchdown dance for 10 seconds,” “Try to name the last 5 Super Bowl MVPs,” or even a quick “wedding party games” challenge for a bonus round.
