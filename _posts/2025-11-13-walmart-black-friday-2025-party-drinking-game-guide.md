Ready to turn Walmart Black Friday 2025 into the wildest event of the year? Forget just shopping—this is your chance to level up your house party ideas with a viral drinking game that blends dare challenges, meme drinking games, and a bit of holiday madness. Whether you’re vibing in a dorm, chilling with friends, or pregaming for a wedding party, these rules make Black Friday unforgettable.

## Why Walmart Black Friday 2025 Is the Perfect Excuse for Drinking Games

Black Friday is already legendary for its chaos, lines, and epic deals. Why not take those wild vibes and create a party drinking game inspired by the madness? This is your ticket to a night packed with laughter, NSFW dares, and meme-worthy moments—no matter where you are in the US, UK, Canada, Australia, or Denmark.

## What You Need

- **A big group of friends** (the more, the messier)
- **Drinks of your choice** (cocktails, beers, or mocktails—your dojo, your rules)
- **A TV, phone, or laptop** to stream Walmart Black Friday news, ads, or live coverage
- **Printed or digital list of dares and challenges** (bonus points for using [Drinking Dojo’s custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com))
- **Shot glasses or cups**
- **A meme generator app** (optional, for the meme drinking games twist)

## How to Play the Walmart Black Friday 2025 Drinking Game

### Setting Up

1. **Tune in** to Walmart Black Friday coverage—TV, live streams, or social media updates.
2. **Split into teams** or play every person for themselves.
3. **Decide on your drink:** beer, cider, cocktails, or non-alcoholic options for the brave.

### The Rules

**Take a sip if:**
- You spot a shopper sprinting for a TV or game console.
- An ad promises “the lowest price ever.”
- Someone in your group predicts a deal before it appears.
- Someone loses their cart (in the video or in real life).

**Take two sips if:**
- You see a viral meme about Black Friday.
- There’s a mention of “doorbuster deals.”
- A teammate tries to claim a deal is fake news.

**Finish your drink or do a dare if:**
- Someone in the footage drops their purchases.
- A fight breaks out over a product (on TV, not your living room—keep it friendly).
- You see a Fortnite drinking game referenced in an ad or meme.

**Wildcard dare challenges:**
- The group votes on the most outrageous shopper and the loser must complete an NSFW dare.
- If a celebrity appears in an ad, the last person to shout their name must do a dare.
- If “Inauguration Day” or “Election Day” is mentioned (hey, it happens), everyone does a wedding party game dare—like proposing to a stranger via DM.

### Bonus Meme Drinking Game Rounds

- **Create-a-Meme:** Pause on a wild Black Friday moment and everyone makes a meme. The funniest wins, the loser drinks.
- **Trending Now:** If a new viral drinking game trend pops up on social, try to recreate it right there.

## Pro Tips for the Ultimate Black Friday Drinking Challenge

- Mix in classic house party ideas like karaoke or couples drinking games between rounds.
- Use Drinking Dojo’s custom drinking game builder to add your own wild rules and dares.
