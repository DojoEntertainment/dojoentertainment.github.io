Summer’s here, and if you’re lucky enough to find yourself packed into a summer house trailer with your crew, you already know one thing: it’s prime time for unforgettable party drinking games. Whether you’re parked by the beach in Australia, chilling lakeside in Canada, or just making the most of a backyard in the US, the summer house trailer is your ultimate playground for wild dare challenges, viral drinking games, and next-level meme drinking games.

Ready to transform your trailer into the HQ of party mayhem? Here’s everything you need to kick things off—rules, how to play, and what you’ll need. Spoiler: things are about to get legendary.

### Essential Materials For Summer House Trailer Drinking Games

Before the games begin, make sure you’ve got the basics:
- Your favorite drinks (obviously)
- Cups (red solo cups if you’re feeling classic)
- A table or any flat surface
- Deck of cards
- Phone with internet for custom drinking game builder tools
- Bluetooth speaker for the vibes
- Friends who are down for a good time

### 1. Meme Kings: Summer Trailer Edition

**Perfect For:** Anyone obsessed with memes and quick on the draw.

**How To Play:**
1. Everyone draws seven meme cards (write or print your favorites before the party, or use your phone and our [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) to create a digital deck).
2. One player shows a viral meme or says a meme phrase.
3. Everyone throws down their funniest card/phone entry as a response.
4. The judge picks the best one; winner gives out three drinks, runner-up gives out one.
5. If your meme flops, take a drink.

**Pro tip:** Spice it up with NSFW dares for the loser, and get ready to screenshot the chaos.

### 2. Dare Roulette

**Perfect For:** Making sure nobody’s just sipping quietly in the corner.

**How To Play:**
1. Write wild dare challenges on slips of paper (think: “shotgun a drink while doing your best Fortnite dance” or “run around the trailer yelling ‘I love house party ideas’”).
2. Everyone draws a dare at random.
3. Complete the dare or take two drinks.
4. The group gets to rate your performance—if you’re extra, assign drinks to others.

**Bonus:** Use the viral [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) to generate new dares and keep things fresh.

### 3. Couples Drinking Games: Trailer Twosomes

**Perfect For:** Couples or besties looking to up the stakes.

**How To Play:**
1. Pair up (romantic or platonic—no judgment).
2. Each pair draws a card with a task (ex: “Create a wedding party game in 2 minutes and play it” or “Confess your wildest house party idea”).
3. If the task is completed, hand out a drink. If not, both partners drink.
4. At the end, the pair with the most completed tasks gets to make a group dare.

### 4. Trailer Tournament: Drinking Challenges

**Perfect For:** The ultra-competitive crowd.

**How To Play:**
1. Set up a bracket (think Fortnite drinking game, flip cup, and classic card games).
2. Winners advance, losers drink.
3. The final champ gets to invent a new dare for the whole group.

**Optional Twists:** Add region-specific challenges—like “sing the Canadian anthem while chugging” or “name five Australian animals before your shot.”

### 5. Themed Nights: Election Day and Inauguration Day Drinking Games

Who says you need an actual event to play these? Give your summer house trailer a random theme and roll with it.

- **Election Day Drinking Game:** Make up “campaign promises,” debate outrageous topics, and drink every time someone can’t keep a straight face.
- **Inauguration Day Drinking Game:** Swear in your “party president,” assign silly cabinet roles, and give dares based on trailer “executive orders.”
