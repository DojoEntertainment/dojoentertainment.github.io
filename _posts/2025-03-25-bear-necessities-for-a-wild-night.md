### Introduction

Welcome to the world of paw-some fun with a unique "bears" inspired drinking game! If you're looking to add a twist to your next gathering, this game might just be the perfect fit. Combining the thrill of drinking games with a touch of wilderness, this bear-themed escapade promises laughter and memorable moments. Gather your friends, stock up on your favorite beverages, and prepare to embrace your inner bear!

### Materials Needed

- A deck of cards
- A large table or open space
- Plenty of your favorite beverages
- A bear hat or costume (optional, but adds to the fun!)

### The Rules of the Game

**Objective:** To have a roaring good time while enjoying some drinks.

1. **Setup:** 
   - Players sit around a table or in a circle.
   - The deck of cards is shuffled and placed at the center.

2. **Gameplay:**
   - Each player takes turns drawing a card from the deck.
   - Depending on the card drawn, the player must perform a specific action:
     - **Number Cards (2-10):** Drink the number of sips corresponding to the card's value.
     - **Jacks:** Growl like a bear! The last person to growl drinks.
     - **Queens:** The player becomes the "Bear Queen" and can make any other player drink at any time until another queen is drawn.
     - **Kings:** All players must stand and perform the "Bear Dance" (a silly dance move). The last player to start dancing drinks.
     - **Aces:** Bear Attack! All players must chug their drinks. The last to finish gets a bear paw print drawn on their face with a washable marker.

3. **End of the Game:**
   - The game ends when the deck runs out or when players decide to stop. The player with the fewest bear paw prints wins the title of "Ultimate Bear Survivor."

### Tips for a Bear-tastic Experience

- **Safety first:** Always ensure everyone is drinking responsibly. Make sure there are non-alcoholic options available for those who prefer them.
- **Bear-themed snacks:** Consider serving bear-shaped cookies or gummy bears to keep the theme going.
- **Bear Costume:** Encourage players to wear bear hats or costumes to immerse themselves fully in the theme.
