Ready to level up your next pregame or house party? With all the hype around Rockstar Games GTA 6, it’s the perfect time to bring the chaos of Los Santos into your living room—drinking dojo style. Whether you’re in the US, UK, Canada, Australia, or Denmark, these party drinking games will turn any GTA 6 hangout into a wild, unforgettable night.

## Why GTA 6 Drinking Games Are the Ultimate Party Move

GTA 6 is all about freedom, mayhem, and wild stories—basically, everything you want in a night with friends. Mixing the thrill of the game with viral drinking games and dare challenges takes your party from basic to legendary. From custom drinking game builder tools to meme drinking games inspired by your favorite GTA moments, we’ve got your back.

## What You’ll Need

- Any GTA game (GTA 6 when it drops, but GTA V works for now)
- A console or PC
- Your favorite drinks (alcoholic or not)
- Dare cards or a phone for random dares
- Drinking Dojo’s [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) for extra spice

## How To Play the Rockstar Games GTA 6 Drinking Game

### **1. Basic Rules**

- **One player controls, everyone else watches**
- When the trigger event happens, everyone drinks or does a dare
- Rotate the controller every 10 minutes or after each “mission”

### **2. Trigger Events and Dare Challenges**

Here’s where it gets wild. Every time one of these happens, grab your drink:

- **Wanted Level Rises:** Take one sip for each star you gain
- **Wasted:** Finish your drink or take a dare from the group
- **Carjacking Gone Wrong:** Everyone drinks if you fail to steal a vehicle
- **Police Chase:** The player must keep drinking until the cops lose you
- **Epic Stunt (success or fail):** Group vote—best stunt gets to assign a dare or drink
- **NPC Insult:** Whenever your character gets roasted or insulted, last person to react drinks

For some NSFW dares, add a twist by letting the custom drinking game builder generate wild tasks every time someone dies in-game or fails a mission.

## Meme Drinking Game Variant

Bring on the memes. Assign viral GTA memes (like “here we go again” moments) to specific drinks or dares. If someone quotes a classic GTA line, the group picks who drinks. Bonus points for best meme reenactment!

## Couples and Wedding Party Twist

- **Couples Drinking Games:** Pair up and compete—last couple standing assigns a group dare.
- **Wedding Party Games:** Make the bride or groom the main player; guests take drinks for every in-game law broken.

## House Party Ideas: Tournament Mode

Set up a bracket. Winners keep the controller, losers face a drinking challenge. The champion gets bragging rights and a custom meme dare from Drinking Dojo.
