## What You’ll Need

- Your favorite drinks (beer, seltzers, cocktails—whatever your crew likes)
- A TV or laptop streaming a Celtics game or Jayson Tatum highlight reel (YouTube is your friend)
- Shot glasses or cups for each player
- Optional: A hoop (mini basketball or trash can + paper ball works for bonus rounds)

## How to Play: Jayson Tatum Drinking Game Rules

Get ready to make every play a party moment! Here’s how to turn any Tatum game (or highlight reel) into one of your new favorite drinking challenges.

### Basic Rules

1. **Pick Your Players**  
   Gather your squad—this game works for duos, couples drinking games, or the whole house party.

2. **Set Up the Stream**  
   Choose a live Celtics game, a Tatum highlight video, or even memes featuring his best moments.

3. **Make It Count**  
   Every time Jayson Tatum does one of the following, everyone drinks:

   - **Scores a basket:** 1 drink
   - **Sinks a three-pointer:** 2 drinks
   - **Dunks:** 3 drinks
   - **Gets fouled:** Last person to raise their glass takes a drink
   - **Celebrates or flexes:** Everyone toasts and drinks
   - **Mention of St. Louis or his son, Deuce:** Dare challenge time! Draw or create a dare using a custom drinking game builder (bonus points for NSFW dares if your group is up for it)

4. **Bonus Shot Round**  
   During breaks or timeouts, set up your own shooting contest. Use a mini hoop or trash can and paper ball—whoever misses has to do a wild dare or take an extra drink.
