There’s something legendary about bowl games: wild plays, epic scores, and bragging rights that last all year. But what if you could bring that same energy straight to your next party? Welcome to the ultimate party drinking game inspired by bowl games scores—where every touchdown, field goal, and meme moment fuels the mayhem.

Whether you’re pregaming with mates in Melbourne, vibing in a London flat, or throwing a snowed-in bash in Toronto, this game is your ticket to unforgettable nights. Let’s break down the rules, get into the dares, and kick up the chaos with Drinking Dojo’s signature twist.

## What You’ll Need for Your Party Drinking Games

- A TV or livestream of the bowl game (or any big sports showdown)
- Your favorite drinks (beer, cider, cocktails, seltzers—whatever’s your style)
- Score tracker (phone app or old-school whiteboard)
- Dare cards (DIY or [grab a pack from Drinking Dojo](https://drinkingdojo.com))
- Custom drinking game builder (optional but 🔥 for personalizing the madness)
- Friends ready for drinking challenges and meme-worthy moments

## How To Play Bowl Games Scores Drinking Game

### The Basics of Drinking Games Inspired by Bowl Scores

1. **Assign Teams**  
   Split your crew into two groups—each rooting for one of the teams. If you’re a small squad, just alternate sides!

2. **Drink For The Score**  
   Every time your team scores, everyone on the *other* team must drink. The number of sips or shots depends on the type of score:
   - **Touchdown**: 6 sips
   - **Field Goal**: 3 sips
   - **Safety**: 2 sips
   - **Extra Point/Conversion**: 1 sip

3. **Dare Challenges for Viral Drinking Games**  
   Whenever the official bowl games scores tie (or hit a meme-worthy number like 21, 69, or 42), it’s dare time. Draw a card or use the custom drinking game builder to generate a wild NSFW dare or meme drinking game challenge. For example:
   - Share your wildest pregame story
   - Do your best Fortnite dance (Fortnite drinking game crossover, anyone?)
   - Let the group send a cheeky DM to your ex
   - Take a snap with the next wedding party you see on social media and toast them

4. **Halftime Mayhem**  
   At halftime, the team with the lowest score must take on a group challenge or dare—think viral drinking games or meme challenges. This is where the real legends are born.

5. **Final Score Showdown**  
   When the final whistle blows, tally up the drinks consumed. The losing team faces one last epic dare—go big or go home!

## House Rules To Level Up Your Party Drinking Games

- **Election Day Drinking Game Mode**: If the bowl game falls on a big event night, add bonus sips for every political ad or meme during commercials.
- **Couples Drinking Games Mode**: Tag-team the dares and score drinks with your partner for double the fun.
- **Wedding Party Games Remix**: If you’re celebrating nuptials, make the dares wedding-themed—you know, “give a toast” or “wear something borrowed” for a round.
- **NSFW Dares**: For the bold, add spicy challenges to the dare deck (just keep it all consensual and friendly).
