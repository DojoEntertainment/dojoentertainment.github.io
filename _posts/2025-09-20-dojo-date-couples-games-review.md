## Updates

Dojo Date is actively updated. The most recent release was in September 2025 and added new categories of content.

## Considerations

- Rated **Mature 17+**, which means some topics are best suited for adult users.  
- While free to download, some packs are behind in-app purchases.  
- Deep conversation prompts may feel heavy if both partners are not comfortable with more personal topics.
