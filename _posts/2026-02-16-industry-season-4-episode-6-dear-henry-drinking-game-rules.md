## What You’ll Need

- **Drinks** (beer, seltzers, cocktails, or your favorite non-alc option)  
- **A screen** to watch industry season 4 episode 6 dear henry (streaming, download, or however you roll)

- **A sense of humor** and willingness to embrace the mayhem  

## How To Play

This drinking game is made for adults who want their house party ideas to go viral. Here’s how it works:

### 1. Set Up Your Squad

- Gather 3–8 friends (more if you want a full-on rager)  
- Pour everyone a drink and get comfy  

### 2. Choose Your Challenge Level

- **Chill Mode**: Sip for minor triggers, shot for wild moments  
- **Go Wild**: Double down on dares and meme drinking game penalties  

### 3. The Rules

**Drink every time:**  
- A character says “Henry”  
- Someone switches alliances or makes a sketchy deal  
- There’s a dramatic phone call or text  
- Anyone mentions money, stocks, or crypto  
- Two characters exchange a look that could kill  

**Dare Challenges:**  
- When a character does something shocking, the group picks one person to pull a dare card (or write a dare on the spot)  
- NSFW dares? Up to your crew, but keep it fun and (reasonably) safe  

**Meme Moment:**  
- If something happens that’s meme-worthy (awkward silence, epic fail, weird fashion), the last person to notice drinks twice and must post a reaction meme in your group chat  

**Bonus Rounds:**  
- **Couples drinking games twist:** If you’re paired up, every time there’s romantic tension onscreen, both partners drink  
- **Wedding party games crossover:** If anyone mentions marriage, everyone toasts
