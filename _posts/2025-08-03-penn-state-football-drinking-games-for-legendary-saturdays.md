If you know, you know: Penn State football Saturdays are absolutely electric. Whether you’re in a packed State College apartment, tailgating with your crew, or cheering from your couch across the pond, there’s nothing like the energy of game day. So why not level up your next watch party with some epic drinking games, daring challenges, and a sprinkle of meme-fueled chaos?

At Drinking Dojo, we’re all about taking those legendary moments and making them unforgettable. Grab your squad (bonus points for blue and white face paint), stock the fridge, and let’s get into the ultimate Penn State football party drinking games.

## The Penn State Touchdown Toast

Nothing brings a crowd together like a touchdown—and nothing gets the party rolling like a communal toast. This classic is a must for any Penn State game.

**How to Play:**
- Every time Penn State scores a touchdown, everyone raises their glass and takes a drink together.
- If the Nittany Lions miss the extra point, finish your drink!
- Bonus: If the camera pans to the Nittany Lion mascot, the last person to roar has to do a dare challenge.

**You’ll Need:**
- Drinks of your choice (beer, seltzer, cocktails—your call)
- Shot glasses for the brave
- A dare list (or just use [Drinking Dojo’s custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) for spicy NSFW dares)

## Meme Drinking Game Madness

Want to keep things viral? Integrate some meme drinking games into your watch party. Every time an announcer drops a classic meme-worthy phrase—think “white out,” “student section goes wild,” or “unrivaled atmosphere”—take a sip.

**Pro Tips:**
- Create a meme bingo card with your friends before kickoff.
- First to complete a row assigns a dare challenge to someone else—prepare for some wild party drinking games moments.
- Share the funniest moments on your group chat (or go viral if you dare).

## Blue and White Dare Challenge

If you’re all about upping the ante, this one’s for you. Each quarter, pick a player (from either team) at random. If that player is mentioned by the commentators, everyone must complete a dare. Use our custom drinking game builder to dish out dares that range from harmless to NSFW dares (depending on your vibe).

**You’ll Need:**
- A hat or bowl with player names
- Dare cards or [Drinking Dojo’s online dare generator](https://drinkingdojo.com)
- Drinks (obviously)

## Couples Drinking Games For Rivalry Romance

Got a game day date? Try this for some flirty competition:

**How to Play:**
- Each of you picks a team (if you’re both Penn State ride-or-die, pick offense vs. defense).
- Every turnover, penalty, or wild play, the “loser” does a drinking challenge or dare.
- Winner gets bragging rights—and maybe something extra after the final whistle.

## House Party Ideas For Next-Level Gamedays

Don’t just stop at the living room. Take your Penn State football party outside with tailgate classics or set up drinking challenges in every room for a full-on house party blitz. Think beer pong with blue and white cups, flip cup relay races, and themed dare cards for every touchdown.

## Game Day Drinking Game Rules Recap

- **Drink responsibly** (seriously, pace yourself—those touchdowns add up)
- **Respect your limits** and your friends’ boundaries (especially with NSFW dares)
- **Stay hydrated and snack up**—nobody likes a hangry Nittany Lion
- **Always have a designated driver or cab ready** if you’re out and about
