If you’re ready to turn your next house party or chill session into a legendary event, you need to try the Mallorca Open drinking game. This drinking game brings the sun-soaked energy of Mallorca straight to your living room—perfect for anyone who loves party drinking games, dare challenges, and a little bit of friendly competition. Whether you’re vibing with your flatmates in London, pregaming in Toronto, or throwing a wedding rager in Sydney, Mallorca Open is your passport to unforgettable fun.

### What You’ll Need

- A deck of cards  
- Your favorite drinks (cocktails, beers, or non-alcoholic for the legends on duty)  
- A group of 3 or more party warriors  
- Optional: Dare cards or meme drinking games packs from [Drinking Dojo](https://drinkingdojo.com) for next-level chaos

### How To Play Mallorca Open

Mallorca Open combines classic party drinking games with custom twists and dare challenges. Here’s how to get started:

#### Step 1: Set Up The Table

- Everyone sits in a circle with their drink and a clear spot in the middle for the cards.
- Shuffle the deck and place it face down.

#### Step 2: The Open

- The first player draws a card, flips it over, and places it in the center.
- Each card equals a different challenge or rule (see below).

#### Step 3: Follow The Card Rules

- *Ace*: Make a rule. Get creative—anything from “no first names” to “speak in a meme voice for one round.”
- *2–6*: Take that many sips.
- *7*: Heaven! Last to point to the ceiling drinks.
- *8*: Mate. Pick a drinking buddy—whenever you drink, they drink too.
- *9*: Rhyme Time. Say a word; go around the circle rhyming until someone fails (they drink).
- *10*: Dare Challenge. Pull a dare from your custom dare pack or make one up on the spot.
- *Jack*: Waterfall. Everyone starts drinking; you can’t stop until the person to your right does.
- *Queen*: Question Master. Anyone who answers your questions drinks until the next Queen is drawn.
- *King*: Mallorca Open! The player who draws a King must start a new round of a custom drinking challenge—think viral drinking games, meme dares, or even themed rounds like the Fortnite drinking game or NSFW dares for the bold.

#### Step 4: Keep The Energy High

- Mix in meme drinking games or couples drinking games for extra flavor.
- For epic moments, try a custom drinking game builder to create Mallorca Open house party ideas that are totally your own.

### Pro Tips For Maximum Mayhem

- Play with regional drinks—try Danish beer, Aussie cider, or classic American cocktails.
- Adapt the dare challenges to fit the crowd: from wedding party games to election day drinking game themes, the options are endless.
- Always drink responsibly and know your limits.
