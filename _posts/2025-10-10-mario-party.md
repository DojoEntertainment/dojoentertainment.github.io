## Warning: This Drinking Game Will Test Your Friendships (Even More Than Mario Party Already Does)

There are two things every gamer knows about _Mario Party_: it is one of the most beloved party games of all time, and it is an absolute friendship-wrecker.

It’s a game of dazzling mini-games, cheerful characters, and the cold, calculated betrayal of stealing a star from your best friend on the final turn. The joyous highs and devastating lows are what make it an enduring classic. But what if you could dial that glorious, friendship-testing chaos all the way up to eleven?

It's time to add another layer of high-stakes fun to the Mushroom Kingdom. Introducing the **[Mario Party Drinking Game](https://drinkingdojo.com/articles/mario-party)**.

### The Perfect Formula for Fun

_Mario Party_ is already built on a foundation of beautiful, unpredictable chaos. A roll of the dice can change everything. A hidden block might hold a game-winning star. A last-minute "Bonus Star" for having the most minigame wins can completely upend the standings.

A drinking game doesn't fight this chaos—it leans into it. Every event, whether it's a triumph or a disaster, becomes a shared experience.

Losing a mini-game stings a little less when everyone else who lost has to drink with you. Landing on a Bowser Space goes from being a dreaded moment to a hilarious one. And finally buying that precious star you've been saving up for? That victory feels even sweeter when you can make your rivals drink to your success. It’s the ultimate way to keep everyone invested and laughing, no matter who's in the lead.
