## What You Need

- Your favorite drinks (beer, cocktails, or mocktails—no judgment here)
- A TV or stream of the Perth Wildcats game
- Dare challenges list (make it spicy with some NSFW dares if your crowd’s up for it)
- Scorecards or your phone’s notes app
- Optional: Drinking Dojo’s [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) for next-level fun

## How to Play the Perth Wildcats Drinking Game

### The Rules

This drinking game is all about riding the highs, groaning at the lows, and making every basket—or turnover—a reason to celebrate. Here’s how to get started:

**1. Pre-Game Setup**
- Make sure everyone has a drink in hand and knows their limits. Safety first!
- Set up your screen for the Perth Wildcats game.
- Split into teams if you want to add a competitive twist.

**2. The Game Play**  
Take a sip, shot, or complete a dare when any of these happen:

#### *Regular Play*
- **Wildcats make a three-pointer:** Everyone cheers and takes a drink.
- **Wildcats miss a free throw:** Do a dare challenge (pull from your list or use the Drinking Dojo builder).
- **Ref makes a questionable call:** Last person to boo takes a drink.
- **Timeout called:** Group selfie—loser of a quick game of rock-paper-scissors drinks.
- **Player scores a dunk:** Everyone does a quick meme drinking game (make up a meme face, loser drinks).

#### *Wildcard Play*
- **Coach gets animated on the sidelines:** Everyone must create their best coach impression. The worst impression drinks.
- **Camera shows a fan in a crazy outfit:** First to spot it nominates someone to drink.
- **Wildcats go on a 10-point run:** All opponents’ fans take two drinks each.

**3. Dare Challenges**  
Mix in some NSFW dares (for the brave) or keep it light with wedding party games or couples drinking games if your group’s more low-key. You can even add viral drinking games rules or house party ideas to keep everyone on their toes.
