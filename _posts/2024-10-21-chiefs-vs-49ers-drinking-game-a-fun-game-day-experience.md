## How to Play

The Chiefs vs 49ers drinking game is all about enjoying the game while taking sips based on specific in-game occurrences. Hereâ€™s how you can play

### Rules

1. **Touchdown Time**  
   Whenever either team scores a touchdown, everyone takes a big sip. If it's a spectacular play, make it two sips!

2. **Field Goal Frenzy**  
   If a field goal is scored, take a smaller sip. For a field goal over 50 yards, make it a big sip.

3. **Interception Insight**  
   When an interception occurs, the person who last touched their drink must finish it.

4. **Penalty Pause**  
   For every penalty called, take a sip. If it's against your favorite team, take two!

5. **Commercial Cheers**  
   During every commercial break, the last person to raise their drink must take a sip.

6. **Quarterly Quench**  
   At the end of each quarter, everyone finishes their current drink and refills for the next quarter.

7. **MVP Moment**  
   If Patrick Mahomes or Brock Purdy makes an outstanding play, everyone must toast to the MVP and take a sip.

8. **Coach's Challenge**  
   When a coach challenges a play, everyone picks a side. If your side loses, take a sip.

### Bonus Round

- **Overtime Overload**  
  If the game goes into overtime, everyone must finish their drink and prepare for a new set of rules which can include any of the above with double the sips!

## Safety First

Remember to drink responsibly and know your limits. Make sure everyone has a safe way home if you've been drinking alcoholic beverages.
