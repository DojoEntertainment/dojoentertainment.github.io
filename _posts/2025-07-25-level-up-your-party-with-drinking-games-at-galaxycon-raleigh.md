Ready to take your Galaxycon Raleigh experience to the next level? Whether you’re cosplaying as your favorite character, queuing up for panels, or just vibing with friends at your hotel, this is the perfect chance to mix fandom fun with some wild party drinking games. Bring the energy of Drinking Dojo to your con crew and make memories that are as unforgettable as your costume.

## Why Drinking Games and Galaxycon Raleigh Are a Perfect Combo

Let’s be real—cons are all about socializing, memes, and letting loose. There’s no better way to bond with new friends or get the squad hyped before a night out than with a round (or five) of creative party drinking games. From meme drinking games that riff on pop culture moments to dare challenges that push your squad out of their comfort zones, these games are made for the wild, unfiltered energy of Galaxycon Raleigh.

## The Ultimate Galaxycon Raleigh Drinking Game Pack

Here’s an easy, custom drinking game builder for your Galaxycon crew—no complicated props, just pure, unfiltered fun.

### What You Need

- Your favorite drinks (alcoholic or not, your call)
- Printed cards or a phone with a note app
- Pens/markers if you want to get artsy
- A group of friends ready to bring the mayhem

### How to Play

1. **Build Your Pack:**  
   Use Drinking Dojo's [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) or jot down your own rules inspired by con happenings, viral drinking games, or inside jokes.

2. **Deal the Cards:**  
   Shuffle your prompts and draw one per turn. Each card is a challenge, dare, or meme moment.

3. **Follow the Rules (Or Not):**  
   The rule is simple: complete the challenge or take a drink. If you’re feeling extra, add NSFW dares (if everyone’s cool with it) or swap in themed tasks like “Take a sip every time you spot a Harley Quinn” or “Drink if you quote a classic meme.”

4. **Meme It Up:**  
   Add meme drinking games challenges—maybe sip when someone shouts “Multiverse!” or when you see a Spider-Man pointing meme IRL.

5. **Level Up With Dare Challenges:**  
   - “Trade cosplay accessories with a stranger.”
   - “Do your best villain laugh in the middle of the lobby.”
   - “Snap a selfie with someone from a fandom you’ve never watched.”

6. **Keep It Moving:**  
   Rotate who draws next, or set a timer for high-energy rounds. The more creative the challenges, the wilder the stories you’ll bring back from Galaxycon Raleigh.

## Pro Tips for Epic Party Drinking Games at Cons

- **Stay Hydrated:** Alternate drinks with water—con weekends are a marathon, not a sprint.
- **Respect Boundaries:** Everyone should feel safe and included. Opt out of any challenge you’re not cool with.
- **Mix It Up:** Use the custom drinking game builder to tailor your pack for different themes—anime night, superhero squads, or NSFW dares for the afterparty.
- **Snap and Share:** Memes happen fast at cons! Capture the best moments for your group chat or next year’s meme drinking games.
