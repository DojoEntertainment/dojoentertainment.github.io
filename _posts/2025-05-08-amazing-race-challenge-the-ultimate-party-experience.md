### How to Play

#### Setting Up the Game

1. **Divide into Teams**: Organize your friends into teams. Each team should have an equal number of players.
   
2. **Create Checkpoints**: Designate areas in your house or venue as checkpoints. Each checkpoint should feature a unique drinking challenge or game, inspired by the "Amazing Race."

3. **Prepare Challenges**: Create a variety of tasks for each checkpoint. Challenges can range from trivia questions related to "Amazing Race" episodes to physical tasks or puzzles.

4. **Assign Drinks**: Each challenge should have an associated drink. Players must complete the challenge and then consume the designated drink before moving on.

#### Rules of the Game

1. **Starting the Race**: Begin the game by setting a starting line. Once all teams are ready, start the timer and let the race begin!

2. **Checkpoint Completion**: Teams must complete each checkpoint in order. Only after successfully finishing the challenge and drinking the assigned beverage can they move to the next checkpoint.

3. **Scoring**: Record each team's time at every checkpoint. Teams earn points based on their completion time and the number of challenges successfully completed.

4. **Winning the Race**: The first team to complete all checkpoints and arrive at the finish line wins the game. In case of a tie, the team with the fastest overall time wins.

5. **Safety First**: Always ensure that players drink responsibly. Provide non-alcoholic options and encourage participants to know their limits.
