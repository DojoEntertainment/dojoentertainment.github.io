Ready to add a little razzle-dazzle to your next party? If you love the spotlight, singalongs, and a little bit of chaos, Broadway shows are the perfect theme for unforgettable drinking games. Whether you’re pregaming before hitting the theater or just want to bring a bit of Broadway magic to your living room, we’ve got the ultimate party drinking games, dare challenges, and meme drinking game ideas inspired by your favorite musicals.

## Why Broadway Shows Make the Best Drinking Game Theme

Think about it: catchy tunes, dramatic plot twists, wild costumes, and enough meme material to keep things spicy all night. With a Broadway-themed drinking game, everyone gets to play a part—no Tony Award required. From wedding party games to rowdy house party ideas, these viral drinking games are sure to steal the show.

## What You’ll Need

- Your favorite Broadway musical (stream it, play the soundtrack, or just act it out)
- Drinks of choice (cocktails, mocktails, or whatever gets your jazz hands going)
- Dare cards, notepads, or the [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) for extra meme drinking games and NSFW dares
- Friends who aren’t afraid to belt out “Defying Gravity” at full volume

## Game 1: Broadway Sips

A classic party drinking game with a show-stopping twist.

**How to play:**
1. Pick a Broadway show to watch or listen to.
2. Everyone pours a drink and picks a character to “follow.”
3. Take a sip every time your character:
   - Breaks into song
   - Dramatically exits a scene
   - Drops a one-liner or meme-worthy phrase
   - Has a costume change (bonus: everyone does a toast)
4. Finish your drink if someone nails the final high note.

**Pro tip:** Use the custom drinking game builder to add your own inside jokes and dares for each musical!

## Game 2: Dare To Dream

Combine dare challenges with meme drinking games for a legendary night.

**How to play:**
1. Before the show, write NSFW dares or meme-worthy challenges on slips of paper.
2. Every time a big musical number kicks off, someone pulls a dare from the pile.
3. The person must complete the dare before the song ends—or take a drink.

**Dare ideas:**
- Reenact the last dramatic scene (Oscar-worthy tears encouraged)
- Serenade your crush with a love ballad
- Perform a TikTok dance challenge to the next song

## Game 3: Couples Cabaret

Perfect for couples drinking games or double-date nights.

**How to play:**
1. Couples team up and pick a favorite duet or love song.
2. Each time a love song plays, couples do a dramatic lip-sync performance.
3. The crowd votes for the best performance. Losers take a shot or dare.

## Bonus: Opening Night Challenge

Turn your next house party into an opening night extravaganza with these drinking challenges:

- **Best Costume:** Whoever shows up dressed as a Broadway character gets to assign drinks.
- **Impromptu Auditions:** At random points, call for an “audition”—everyone must sing a line from a show. Worst performance does a dare.
- **Standing Ovation:** If someone nails a song or dance, everyone else drinks.
