Every year, the clock jumps ahead or falls back—and whether you gain or lose an hour, it’s the perfect excuse to turn that time shift into an epic party drinking game. Why let daylight savings mess with your sleep schedule when you could be making new (and slightly blurry) memories? Gather your squad, stock up your favorite drinks, and get ready to play some viral drinking games inspired by that twice-a-year clock chaos.

## Daylight Savings Drinking Game: The Basics

**Materials Needed:**
- Your drink of choice (beer, cocktails, seltzers—whatever gets you in the spirit)
- Smartphone or clock (for time checks)
- Dare cards or meme templates (optional: grab some from [Drinking Dojo](https://drinkingdojo.com))
- Friends who can handle daylight savings and a little bit of mayhem

### How To Play

**1. Pre-Game Setup**
- Pick your pack—whether you’re into meme drinking games, classic party drinking games, or custom drinking game builder challenges, set the vibe before the clock changes.
- Everyone pours a drink, and you appoint a Timekeeper (preferably someone who actually knows how daylight savings works).

**2. Rules For The Main Event**
- **Every time someone asks “What time is it?”**—everyone drinks.
- **If someone forgets the time change and shows up late/early**—they do a dare challenge from the pile (or grab an NSFW dare if you’re feeling spicy).
- **When the clock actually changes (forward or back)**—group cheers and everyone finishes their current drink.
- **If anyone references losing sleep, being tired, or “extra hour”**—they take two sips.
- **Bonus:** The Timekeeper can shout “Time Warp!” at random, and everyone must swap drinks or seats.

**3. Meme Madness**
- Pull up your favorite daylight savings memes (or create your own). The group votes on the funniest; the loser takes a shot or does a dare.
- Share the wildest meme in your group chat for extra embarrassment points.

### Custom Drinking Game Builder: Make It Yours

Want to level up? Use our [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) to create a daylight savings challenge tailored to your crew. Add in some house party ideas, wedding party games, or couples drinking games to keep things fresh, no matter the occasion.

## Dare Challenges To Keep Things Wild

- **Set Your Alarm:** Set your phone alarm for a random time. When it goes off, you have to take a shot no matter what you’re doing.
- **Time Traveler:** Attempt to explain daylight savings to the group in under 30 seconds. Fail? Drink.
- **Reverse Order:** For one round, everyone drinks with their non-dominant hand.

## Why Daylight Savings Parties Hit Different

From university dorms in the US and UK, to late-night hangs in Canada, Australia, and Denmark, daylight savings is the ultimate excuse to get together, laugh at the chaos, and try some new drinking challenges. Whether you’re into viral drinking games or want to try a Fortnite drinking game twist (every time the clock changes, drop into another round?), there’s no end to the party potential.

## Time To Drink Like The Clock’s Ticking

Ready to make the most of your missing (or extra) hour? Grab your mates, set your alarms, and let the daylight savings drinking games begin. For more dare challenges, meme drinking games, and wild party drinking games, check out all the packs and tools at [Drinking Dojo](https://drinkingdojo.com).
