## The Classic Britney Spears Drinking Game: Party Drinking Games at Their Best

### How To Play

1. **Set up your playlist:** Shuffle Britney’s greatest hits. Every player grabs their drink and gets comfy.
2. **Assign the rules:** When certain lyrics, dance moves, or video moments happen, everyone drinks. You can play with music videos or just the audio!

### The Rules for This Viral Drinking Game

- **Every time Britney says “baby”:** Take a sip.
- **Every time she does a hair flip:** Take two sips.
- **Chorus time:** Last person to sing along takes a dare.
- **Someone does a Britney impression (singing or dancing):** The group votes on how good it was. If it was a flop, the performer drinks. If it slayed, everyone else drinks.
- **NSFW dares:** If you’re feeling bold, add some NSFW dares into the mix for extra spice.
- **Bonus round:** If “Toxic” comes on, everyone must freeze in a dramatic pose—last to freeze drinks.

## Dare Challenges: Britney Edition for Next-Level Drinking Challenges

Take the game up a notch by mixing in custom dare challenges. Here are a few ideas to get your crew laughing (and maybe cringing):

- Lip-sync battle to “Oops!...I Did It Again”—loser takes a shot.
- Recreate Britney’s iconic dance from “Slave 4 U” (snake optional).
- Perform your best British accent during “Piece of Me” or drink.
- Meme drinking games: Every time someone drops a Britney meme in the group chat, assign a dare.

## House Party Ideas with Britney Vibes: Perfect for Wedding Party Games & More

- **Wedding party games:** Got a bachelorette or wedding after-party? Britney challenges are the perfect way to get everyone on their feet.
- **Couples drinking games:** Pair up and see which couple knows more Britney lyrics—losers do a dare challenge.
- **Fortnite drinking game crossover:** For the gamers, try “Britney x Fortnite” mode: every time you get eliminated, do your best Britney dance before sipping.
