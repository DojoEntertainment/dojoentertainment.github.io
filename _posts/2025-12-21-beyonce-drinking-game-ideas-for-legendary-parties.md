Ready to turn your next pregame, house party, or wedding afterparty into a true Queen B-level event? Whether you’re channeling your inner Sasha Fierce or just vibing with friends, a Beyonce-inspired drinking game is the ultimate way to bring the crowd together. At Drinking Dojo, we’re all about unforgettable drinking games, viral moments, and dare challenges that are as iconic as Beyonce herself.

## Why Beyonce Drinking Games Rule

Let’s face it: everyone knows at least one Beyonce anthem, and everyone has a favorite meme-worthy moment from her glittering career. Mixing her legendary hits, unforgettable dance moves, and meme drinking games into your night? Instant party upgrade. This is your chance to slay the game, create wild memories, and maybe even dare your mates to try that “Single Ladies” dance (don’t worry, we’ve got plenty of NSFW dares and custom drinking game builder tools to keep things spicy).

## How To Play The Ultimate Beyonce Drinking Game

### What You’ll Need

- Any music streaming service (Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube)  
- A playlist of Beyonce hits (think “Crazy in Love,” “Formation,” “Irreplaceable,” and more)  
- Your favorite drinks (cocktails, beers, or mocktails)  
- Dare cards or access to [Drinking Dojo’s custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com)  
- A group of Queen B fans (or soon-to-be fans)  

### Game Setup

1. **Create Your Playlist:** Load up a playlist with classic Beyonce tracks and viral hits.
2. **Choose Your Drinking Game Mode:** Go classic with song-based cues, or spice it up with meme drinking games and dare challenges.
3. **Set The House Rules:** Decide on sip amounts, NSFW dares, and any bonus challenges for your group.

### Beyonce Drinking Game Rules

#### Classic Song Cues

- **Take a Sip:** Every time someone sings “uh-oh” (think “Crazy in Love”), everyone takes a sip.
- **Finish Your Drink:** If anyone nails the “Single Ladies” dance, everyone else finishes their drink.
- **Dare Challenge:** Drop a dare every time Beyonce says “flawless.” Use our [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) for unique dares tailored to your squad.
- **Group Toast:** Whenever a power ballad starts, everyone must toast “to Queen B” and down a shot.
- **NSFW Dare:** If someone messes up the lyrics, pick an NSFW dare from the pack, or create your own wild challenge.

#### Meme Moments

- Every time someone references a viral Beyonce meme (hello, “Becky with the good hair”), the group drinks.
- If a song from her Destiny’s Child era plays, everyone does their best runway walk—winner assigns drinks.
