## How To Play

This game is all about catching Emma Raducanu’s iconic moments — and turning them into epic dare challenges. It’s perfect for house party ideas, pregame sessions, or even wedding party games if your crew is sporty.

### Basic Rules

1. **Pick your players.**  
   Gather your group and choose your drinks.

2. **Start the match.**  
   Stream any Emma Raducanu tennis match. If you’re short on time, grab some highlights.

3. **Drink when…**
   - Emma hits an ace  
     *Everyone takes one sip.*
   - She wins a set  
     *Last person to cheer does a dare challenge.*
   - Commentators mention her age or “teen sensation”  
     *Take two sips.*
   - She pumps her fist  
     *Everyone high-fives and drinks.*
   - The camera pans to her team or family  
     *Person wearing the most red drinks.*
   - There’s a meme-worthy moment (awkward crowd shot, wild reaction, etc.)  
     *Vote for someone to do a NSFW dare.*

4. **Special Rules**
   - **Double Faults:** Player who last double-tapped on Instagram drinks.
   - **Rally Challenge:** During any rally longer than 10 shots, everyone starts sipping and can’t stop until the point ends.

### Dares And Challenges
