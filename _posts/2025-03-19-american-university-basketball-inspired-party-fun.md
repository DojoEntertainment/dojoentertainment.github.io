And what better way to enhance the thrill of the game than with a themed party activity? Enter our basketball-inspired party game that combines the love of the sport with a social twist.

### Introduction

American university basketball is more than just a sport; it’s a cultural phenomenon that brings people together, uniting fans with cheers, passionate debates, and unforgettable moments. While watching your favorite teams battle it out on the court, add an extra layer of enjoyment with a game that keeps the energy high and spirits even higher.

### Game Essentials

To get started, you’ll need:

- A television or streaming setup to watch the basketball game
- Beverage of choice (alcoholic or non-alcoholic)
- Cups for each participant
- A basketball-themed scoreboard (optional)
- A group of friends ready to have a good time

### How to Play

1. **Set Up**  
   Arrange your viewing area so everyone has a clear view of the game. Set up a table with beverages and cups within easy reach. If you’re using a scoreboard, place it where everyone can see it.

2. **Game Rules**  
   The rules are simple and designed to keep everyone engaged from tip-off to the final buzzer. Here’s how it works:

   - **Tip-Off Toast**: Everyone takes a drink at the start of the game.
   - **Free Throw Cheers**: When a player from your favorite team makes a free throw, take a sip to celebrate their success.
   - **Three-Point Shoutout**: If a player scores a three-pointer, the room erupts in cheers, and everyone takes a drink.
   - **Foul Play Fun**: If a player on your team commits a foul, it’s time for a penalty drink.
   - **Halftime Halftime**: As the teams regroup, so do you. Take a break and refresh your drinks.
   - **Buzzer Beater Bonus**: If the game ends with a buzzer beater, celebrate the excitement with a group toast.

3. **Safety First**  
   Remember, the primary goal is to have fun responsibly. Ensure all participants are of legal drinking age and encourage pacing to maintain a safe and enjoyable atmosphere. Consider providing non-alcoholic options for those who prefer them.

### Adding a Competitive Edge

Want to up the stakes? Introduce a friendly competition by keeping track of points with your scoreboard. Award points for each successful drink completed according to the rules, and crown a “Game Day MVP” at the end of the night.
