## Why Day Light Savings Parties Are Legendary

Let’s be real—day light savings is confusing, but that’s what makes it legendary for parties. It’s the perfect setup for hilarious meme drinking games and custom dare challenges that keep everyone on their toes. Plus, when time literally changes overnight, it’s only right to bend a few rules and get a little wild. From classic party drinking games to couples drinking games that spark some romance, this is your ticket to making day light savings unforgettable.

## Top Day Light Savings Drinking Games

### 1. The Lost Hour Challenge

**Materials Needed:**
- Deck of cards
- Drinks for everyone
- Timer (your phone works!)

**How to Play:**
1. Set a timer for 60 minutes (the “lost hour”).
2. Each player draws a card every 10 minutes.
3. Each suit means a different dare challenge:
   - **Hearts:** Share your wildest meme or do a viral drinking game dare.
   - **Spades:** Take a shot or sip.
   - **Diamonds:** Make up a house rule for the next round.
   - **Clubs:** Pick a player to answer an NSFW dare.
4. When the timer’s up, everyone downs their drink to celebrate surviving the lost hour!

**Perfect For:** House parties, dorm hangouts, or spontaneous pregame sessions.

### 2. Spring Forward Sips

**Materials Needed:**
- List of classic and custom dares (use the [Drinking Dojo custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com))
- Drinks
- Notepad and pen

**How to Play:**
1. Write down dares on slips of paper—think wedding party games, couples drinking games, or even a Fortnite drinking game round if you’re feeling spicy.
2. Toss them in a hat or bowl.
3. Every time someone asks, “What time is it?” or complains about the time change, they draw a dare and must complete it or take a drink.

**Pro Tip:** Bonus points for adding in viral drinking games or meme challenges—everyone loves a TikTok-worthy moment.

### 3. The Day Light Switch

**Materials Needed:**
- Two different drinks (beer and spirits work great)
- Coin

**How to Play:**
1. Sit in a circle and flip the coin.
2. Heads = everyone takes a sip of drink #1, Tails = drink #2.
3. But—if you forget what drink matches which side, you’re in for an NSFW dare or a round of drinking challenges.

**Great For:** Breaking the ice with new friends or heating things up with couples drinking games.
