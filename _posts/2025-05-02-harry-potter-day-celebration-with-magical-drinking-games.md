### Introduction

Welcome, fellow witches and wizards, to a magical celebration of Harry Potter Day! Whether you're a Gryffindor, Slytherin, Hufflepuff, or Ravenclaw, there's no better way to honor the magical world of Hogwarts than by hosting a spellbinding party with some enchanting drinking games. Gather your friends, grab your wands (and your drinks), and step into a world where merriment meets magic. But remember, even in the wizarding world, it's important to drink responsibly. 

### Hogwarts House Challenge

#### Materials Needed:
- A variety of drinks (preferably in Gryffindor red, Slytherin green, Hufflepuff yellow, and Ravenclaw blue)
- House-themed decorations
- A Sorting Hat (or designated sorter)

#### How to Play:
1. **Sort Your Guests**: Upon arrival, each guest is sorted into one of the four Hogwarts houses. You can use a Sorting Hat, an online quiz, or even a simple draw from a hat.
   
2. **House Points**: Throughout the evening, guests earn points for their respective houses by winning mini-games, answering trivia questions correctly, or simply being the most enthusiastic participant.

3. **Drinking Rules**:
   - If your house wins a mini-game, everyone else takes a sip.
   - If a guest answers a trivia question incorrectly, they take a sip.
   - If someone quotes a line incorrectly from the movies or books, they take a sip.

4. **House Cup**: At the end of the night, the house with the most points wins the House Cup, and the other houses must toast to their victory.

### The Triwizard Tournament Toast

#### Materials Needed:
- Three different drinks representing each task
- A goblet or chalice for each player

#### How to Play:
1. **First Task - Dragon's Fire**: Fill the goblet with a fiery drink of your choice (such as spiced rum or cinnamon whiskey). Drink if you fail to recall a dragon's name from the Triwizard Tournament.

2. **Second Task - Underwater Adventure**: Fill the goblet with a blue-colored cocktail. Drink if you can't name a character who participated in the underwater task.

3. **Third Task - The Maze**: Fill the goblet with a dark, mysterious drink (like a stout or dark ale). Drink if you can't name a spell used in the maze.

### Quidditch Cup Cheers

#### Materials Needed:
- A broomstick (for decoration)
- Plastic cups
- A small ball (to act as a quaffle)

#### How to Play:
1. **Set Up**: Arrange cups at each end of a table to represent goals.

2. **Teams**: Divide players into two teams.

3. **Gameplay**:
   - Players attempt to throw the ball through the opposing team's cups.
   - Each successful throw means the opposing team must take a drink.
   - First team to clear the other team's cups wins the match.
