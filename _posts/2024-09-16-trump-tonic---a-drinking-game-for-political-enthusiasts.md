title: # Trump Tonic - A Drinking Game for Political Enthusiasts
---


Gather your friends, grab your favorite drinks, and get ready for a wild night of laughter and political banter with our drinking game inspired by the one and only Trump! Whether you’re a supporter or a skeptic, this game is sure to ignite some spirited discussions and bring out everyone's funny side. So, let’s dive into the rules, how to play, and what you’ll need to make your night unforgettable.

## What You Need

- A group of friends (4 or more recommended)
- Drinks of your choice (beer, cocktails, soda, whatever gets the party going)
- A TV or streaming device to watch Trump-related media (speeches, interviews, debates, or even his reality show cameos)
- A notepad or a phone to keep track of points (optional but fun)

## How to Play

1. **Choose Your Media**: Select a Trump-related video or event to watch. It could be his latest speech, a classic debate, or an episode of a show featuring him. The more entertaining, the better!

2. **Set the Rules**: Before you start watching, establish the following triggers. Each time one of these happens, everyone takes a drink. Here are some suggestions:
   - Take a sip when Trump mentions "fake news."
   - Take a drink when he talks about building the wall.
   - Finish your drink if he makes a bold claim without evidence.
   - Take a sip whenever he refers to himself in the third person.
   - Drink whenever someone in the video is visibly confused or shocked.

3. **Bonus Challenges**: For added fun, include a few bonus challenges. These can be done at any time during the viewing:
   - If someone can mimic Trump’s voice perfectly, everyone else takes a drink.
   - If anyone can come up with a spontaneous Trump-themed pun, the pun master can point out someone to finish their drink.

4. **Point System**: To amp up the competition, you can add a point system. Each time you take a drink for a trigger, you earn a point. At the end of the game, the person with the most points gets to choose a “punishment” for the players with the least points (perhaps a silly dance or a karaoke performance).

5. **Ending the Game**: The game ends after the video or event concludes. You can either declare a winner based on points or simply laugh about the ridiculousness of the night!

## Final Thoughts

Trump Tonic is not just about drinking; it’s about enjoying the hilarity of politics with friends. Just remember to drink responsibly and know your limits. Whether you’re discussing policies or poking fun at the latest headlines, this game is all about having a good time.

So, what are you waiting for? Gather your friends, turn on that Trump special, and let the games begin! Cheers to a night of laughter, debate, and maybe a few surprises along the way.
