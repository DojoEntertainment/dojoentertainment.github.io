Whether you're a parade enthusiast or just looking for another way to enjoy the festivities, this game is sure to bring joy and laughter to your holiday gathering.

## How to Play

The Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade Drinking Game is simple and perfect for a group setting. Gather your friends and family, grab your favorite drinks, and get ready to spot some parade classics.

### Materials Needed

- Television or streaming device to watch the parade
- A selection of your favorite drinks
- A list of spotting cues (see below)

### Spotting Cues

Prepare to take a drink when you see or hear any of the following during the parade:

1. **A Giant Balloon**  
   Whenever a giant character balloon floats by, take a sip. Bonus sip if it's a character that debuted before 1990.

2. **A Marching Band**  
   Every time a marching band plays, take a drink. Extra sip for any impressive baton twirling.

3. **A Celebrity Appearance**  
   When a celebrity makes an appearance, toast to their success and take a sip. Double it if they attempt to sing live.

4. **Santa Claus**  
   When the jolly man in red makes his grand entrance, it's time for a celebratory drink.

5. **Broadway Performance**  
   Spot a Broadway performance, and take a sip. If you can name the show, everyone else takes a drink.

6. **Parade Host Mention**  
   Take a sip every time a host mentions the weather, the size of the crowd, or their favorite float.

### Bonus Round

- **Macy's Logo Spotting**  
  Whoever spots the Macy's logo first during a commercial or parade segment assigns a drink to a person of their choice.

### Safety First
