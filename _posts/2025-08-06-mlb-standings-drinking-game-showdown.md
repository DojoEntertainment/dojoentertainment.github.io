Who says baseball season is just for the die-hard fans? At Drinking Dojo, we know any excuse is a good excuse for party drinking games—and MLB standings are the perfect fuel for a wild, unpredictable night. Whether you’re pregaming for a big game, vibing with friends, or need house party ideas that hit a home run, grab your squad and get ready for a viral drinking game that’ll leave you cheering (or jeering) your way through the standings.

### What You’ll Need for Your MLB Drinking Game

- A device to pull up the latest MLB standings (phone, laptop, TV)
- Drinks of choice (beer, cocktails, or mocktails—no judgment)
- A pack of cards or our [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) for extra dares
- Optional: Team hats or jerseys for added chaos

### How To Play the MLB Standings Drinking Game

**1. Pick Your Teams**

Each player or duo claims an MLB team from the current standings. If you’ve got a big group, double up or draft teams snake-style to keep things spicy.

**2. Check the Standings**

Pull up the latest MLB standings—division rankings, wild card, the whole shebang. You’ll use these to determine your fate (and your sips).

**3. Drink By The Numbers**

Every round, follow these rules:

- **Your team is in first place:** Hand out 2 sips to anyone. You’re the king/queen tonight.
- **Your team is in last place:** Take 2 sips and complete a dare challenge (from the Dojo’s deck or your own NSFW dares).
- **Your team just won a game:** Everyone else drinks.
- **Your team just lost a game:** You drink and do a meme drinking game—think dramatic re-creations of viral baseball moments.
- **Tie-breaker?** Everyone drinks!

**4. The Dare Inning**

Every time a team enters or leaves the top three in their division, the player representing that team must draw a dare. Use the [Drinking Dojo custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) to add wild twists: from “sing your team’s anthem” to “post your best baseball meme in the group chat.”

**5. Bonus Rounds for Extra Fun**

Spice it up with these house party ideas:

- **Couples drinking games:** Pairs rep a team together—if their team rises in the standings, they do a victory dance (or a dare).
- **Wedding party games:** Assign teams to tables—winning team gets first crack at the drinks cart.
- **Drinking challenges:** Last-place teams go head-to-head in a flip cup battle.

### Why MLB Standings Drinking Games Hit Different

This isn’t your average party drinking game. With every standings update, the stakes shift—so every inning brings new dares, wild card twists, and meme-worthy moments. Baseball fans and total newbies alike get in on the action. Whether you’re in the US, UK, Canada, Australia, or Denmark, this is the drinking game that keeps everyone on their toes.

And if MLB isn’t your jam, tweak the rules for other sports (or try our fortnite drinking game or inauguration day drinking game for a change-up).
