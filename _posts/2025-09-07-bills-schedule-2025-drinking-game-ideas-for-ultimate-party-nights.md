## Top Bills Schedule 2025 Drinking Games

### 1. Bills Blitz  
**Materials Needed:**  
- Drinks of choice (beer, cider, seltzer—whatever fuels your fandom)  
- Bills game on TV  
- Custom dare cards (optional for extra spice)  

**How to Play:**  
- Everyone picks a player to "draft" for the game.  
- Whenever your player is mentioned by the commentator, take a sip.  
- If your player scores a touchdown, finish your drink or complete a dare challenge.  
- If the Bills win, everyone does a celebratory meme drinking game—think TikTok dance while chugging.

**Rules:**  
- No switching players mid-game.  
- If two people pick the same player, both have to double up on dares if that player is penalized.

### 2. Table Slam Tailgate  
**Materials Needed:**  
- Drinks  
- Table (for that classic Bills tailgate energy)  
- Dare cards or custom challenges  

**How to Play:**  
- Before kickoff, everyone writes down a wild dare on a piece of paper (keep it NSFW dares if your crowd’s into it).  
- Place all dares in a bowl.  
- Every time the Bills defense gets a turnover, someone randomly draws and completes a dare.  
- For every Bills touchdown, everyone must tap their drink on the table and shout “Go Bills!” before taking a shot.

**Rules:**  
- No skipping dares—if you refuse, you finish your drink!  
- Add meme drinking game tasks for extra laughs (e.g., “make up a touchdown dance”).
