If you’re on the hunt for party drinking games that instantly crank up the chaos, Kraken should be on your radar. This viral drinking game has been making waves at house parties, weddings, and dorm rooms from the US to Denmark. Whether you’re a meme drinking game veteran or just looking for fresh house party ideas, Kraken is the perfect mix of dare challenges, custom rules, and ice-breaking fun.

## What Is Kraken?  

Kraken isn’t just a mythical sea monster—it’s a wild, high-energy drinking game packed with unpredictable twists. This isn’t your average circle-of-death scenario. Kraken combines drinking challenges, NSFW dares (if you want!), and social chaos, making it a must-have for your next get-together.

## What You Need To Play Kraken

- A group of thirsty legends (4+ players recommended)
- A large table or floor space  
- One deck of cards  
- Plenty of your favorite drinks  
- Optional: a custom drinking game builder (like the one at [Drinking Dojo](https://drinkingdojo.com)) to add a personal twist

## Kraken Drinking Game Rules

### Setup

1. Sit everyone in a circle around the table or on the floor.
2. Place the deck of cards face down in the center.
3. Pick someone to go first—maybe the last person who saw a Kraken meme.

### How To Play

1. On your turn, draw a card and reveal it to the group.
2. Each card number or suit triggers a specific action. (See below for example rules.)
3. When a “Kraken” card is drawn (choose a wild card like Joker or Ace), everyone yells “Release the Kraken!” and chaos erupts.

#### Example Card Actions

- **Number Cards (2–10):** Take that number of sips.
- **Face Cards:**
    - Jack: Make a rule (get creative—ban certain words, silly accents, etc.).
    - Queen: Dare challenge! The player must complete a dare from the group or the custom drinking game builder.
    - King: Pour some of your drink into the central “Kraken Cup.” Whoever draws the next Kraken card must down it.
- **Aces or Jokers (Kraken Card):**
    - Everyone stands up and spins in a circle while chugging their drink (or until the Kraken Cup is finished if you’ve got a champion).
    - The last person to finish their drink or the one who spins the slowest takes a dare or shot.

### Bonus: Memes and NSFW Dares

Want to add a meme drinking game twist? Assign meme-inspired dares for the Queen card. Feeling bold? Use custom NSFW dares for late-night sessions or couples drinking games.

## Kraken Drinking Game Variations

- **Wedding Party Games:** Replace dares with wedding-themed challenges—think “pose for a fake proposal” or “give an impromptu toast.”
- **Couples Drinking Games:** Make certain cards trigger flirty dares or partner mini-games.
- **House Party Ideas:** Use the custom drinking game builder at Drinking Dojo to drop in your group’s inside jokes, viral memes, or region-specific twists—imagine a Fortnite drinking game crossover or an inauguration day drinking game variation!

## Why Kraken Is The Ultimate Party Drinking Game

Kraken stands out because it’s easy to learn, wild to play, and endlessly customizable. Whether you’re in the US, UK, Canada, Australia, or Denmark, this drinking challenge will have your crew roaring with laughter (and maybe a little regret the next morning).
