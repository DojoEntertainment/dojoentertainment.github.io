Are you ready to turn your next game night or house party into an absolute highlight reel? Sports and drinking games are a match made in party heaven—just think about the energy, the competition, the viral drinking game moments, and the wild dares that come out when your squad gets together. Whether you’re watching the big game, planning wedding party games, or just vibing with friends, it’s time to bring the sports summary spirit to your party drinking games.

## Why Sports and Drinking Games Are the Ultimate Combo

Sports bring people together. Drinking games make things unforgettable. Put them together and you get a high-energy, meme-worthy party that feels like a championship win. These games are perfect for any crew—from roommates in the UK kicking back on a Saturday, to Aussies amping up a backyard BBQ, to Canadians bringing the heat during hockey playoffs.

Ready to play? Here’s our take on the best sports summary drinking games, with rules, how to play, and what you’ll need.

## The Classic Sports Summary Drinking Game

### What You Need

- A TV or device (for watching any sport: football, basketball, tennis, even esports like Fortnite)
- Drinks for everyone
- A group of fun-loving adults (18+)
- Printed or digital list of sports summary actions (keep reading!)

### How To Play

1. **Choose Your Sport**  
   Pick any live or replayed sporting event—NFL, Premier League, Wimbledon, or even a Fortnite tournament.  
2. **Set Up the Sports Summary Rules**  
   Assign drinking actions to classic sports moments. For example:
   - Goal/Touchdown/Score: Everyone drinks
   - Foul/Penalty: Last person to react drinks
   - Epic Save/Clutch Play: Make a dare challenge (think NSFW dares if your crew’s into it)
   - Meme Moment (awkward interviews, wild fans, funny mascots): Do a shot
   - Overtime/Extra time: Double drink round  
3. **Bring in Some Custom Action**  
   Use Drinking Dojo’s [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) to tailor the dares and challenges to your group, the teams playing, or even the commentators!  
4. **Keep Score or Go Free-For-All**  
   Either track who’s winning (loser does a viral drinking challenge at the end), or just vibe and enjoy the chaos.

## Epic Dare Challenges for Sports Fans

Spice up your night with these wild dares:

- Make a meme-worthy face every time the ref blows the whistle  
- Attempt a mini-sport in the living room (sock soccer, anyone?)—loser drinks  
- Predict the next play—wrong guess, you chug  
- Wedding party games twist: whoever picks the losing team has to give a toast!

These dares get even better if you throw in some NSFW dares for adults-only parties or adapt them for couples drinking games.

## Pro Tips for Next-Level Party Drinking Games

- Don’t forget the snacks! Sports and drinking games are a marathon, not a sprint.  
- Use streaming services or YouTube for endless sports content—perfect for house party ideas in any region.  
- Try themed games for special events: Election day drinking game or inauguration day drinking game for the politically-minded crowd.
