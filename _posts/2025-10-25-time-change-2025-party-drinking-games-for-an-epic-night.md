### 1. **Hourglass Havoc**

**What you need:**  
- A timer or hourglass  
- Drinks of choice  
- Dare cards (make your own or use our [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com))

**How to play:**  
- Set a timer for 15 minutes.  
- Each player draws a dare challenge card and must complete it before the timer runs out.  
- If you finish your dare, you nominate someone else for a shot.  
- If you fail, take a drink and draw another dare.  
- When the timer dings, everyone refills and the round starts again. Try our wild NSFW dares for extra spice!

### 2. **Forward or Back**

**What you need:**  
- Deck of cards  
- Drinks  
- Paper and pens

**How to play:**  
- Assign “forward” to red cards and “back” to black cards.  
- Each round, a player draws a card. If it’s red, nominate someone to drink; if it’s black, you drink.  
- Special rule: If someone draws an ace, everyone writes down a dare. Mix them up and draw one—whoever picks has to do it or double their drink!

### 3. **Meme Midnight**

**What you need:**
