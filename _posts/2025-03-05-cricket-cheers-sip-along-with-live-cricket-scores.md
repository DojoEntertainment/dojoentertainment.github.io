### Game Rules

The rules are simple and designed to keep the game engaging without overshadowing the cricket match itself. Here's how you can play:

1. **Boundary Cheers**: Whenever a batsman hits a four or a six, everyone takes a sip. It’s a classic way to celebrate the batsman’s prowess.
   
2. **Wicket Whirl**: If a wicket falls, it’s time for a group toast. Everyone raises their glass and takes a hearty drink to commiserate or celebrate, depending on which team you're supporting.

3. **Score Surges**: Every time the score crosses an increment of 50 (like 50, 100, 150, and so on), take a sip. This adds excitement as teams approach significant milestones.

4. **Appeal Alert**: Cricket is full of appeals. Whenever the fielding team appeals, take a sip. This rule ensures that you’re paying attention to the fielding side’s strategies.

5. **Commentator Cues**: Choose a specific word or phrase that commentators frequently use, like "fantastic shot" or "unbelievable". Every time it’s mentioned, take a sip. This keeps the game dynamic and unpredictable.

6. **End of Innings**: At the end of each innings, everyone finishes their glass. It’s a way to mark the transition in the game and prepare for the next thrilling round.

### How to Play

1. **Gather Your Group**: Assemble a group of friends who are enthusiastic about cricket. This game is all about the shared experience and the collective enjoyment of the sport.

2. **Set Up Your Space**: Ensure that you have a comfortable viewing area with a good view of the screen. Arrange snacks and drinks within easy reach.
