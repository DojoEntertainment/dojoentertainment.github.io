Looking for a wild twist on classic party drinking games? Whether you’re pregaming, hosting a house party, or just searching “walmart near me” for a last-minute run, we’ve cooked up the ultimate Walmart Drinking Game to turn any night into an unforgettable adventure. Grab your squad, fire up your group chat, and let’s get this party started—dojo-style.

## What Is the Walmart Near Me Drinking Game?

This viral drinking game is all about mixing the thrill of a shopping trip with the chaos of dare challenges. It’s perfect for anyone who loves meme drinking games, NSFW dares, and custom drinking game builders. Plus, it works whether you’re in the US, UK, Canada, Australia, or Denmark—just swap in your local supermarket if Walmart isn’t your go-to.

## What You’ll Need

- Your phone (with maps or the Walmart app)
- A group of thirsty friends (3+ is ideal)
- Drinks of your choice (responsibly, of course)
- A list of dares or challenges (or use [Drinking Dojo’s custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com))
- A sense of humor and zero shame

## How to Play the Walmart Drinking Game

### Step 1: Pre-Game Prep

Before you head out, gather at someone’s place and pick your drink of choice. Create two lists:
- **Shopping dares:** “Find the weirdest item,” “Take a selfie with a mannequin,” “Ask an employee for something that doesn’t exist.”
- **Party dares:** “Do your best Fortnite dance in an aisle,” “Sing the chorus of your favorite meme song,” “Recite your favorite NSFW dare challenge.”

### Step 2: Hit the “Walmart Near Me”

Use your phone to find the closest Walmart (or equivalent). Pile into a car, walk, or hop on public transit—however your crew rolls.

### Step 3: The Scavenger Hunt

Once you arrive, split into teams or stick together. Each team must complete as many dares as possible within a set time (usually 30–45 minutes). Snap photo or video proof of every completed challenge.

### Step 4: The After-Party

Head back home, pour another round, and let the games begin:
- For every challenge your team *didn’t* complete, take a drink.
- For the most hilarious photo or video, the group votes—and the winner hands out drinks.
- Add bonus rounds: Integrate other party drinking games like couples drinking games or wedding party games for extra chaos.

## Pro Tips for Going Viral

- Turn your Walmart near me adventure into a TikTok or Insta Reel—meme drinking games are all about the LOLs.
- Use Drinking Dojo’s custom drinking game builder to create personalized dares tailored to your crew.
- Want more? Mix in themed games like Fortnite drinking game or election day drinking game for epic variety.

## Safety First

- Always respect store employees and fellow shoppers.
- Drink responsibly, know your limits, and have a designated driver if you’re heading out.
- In some countries or locations, you might need to swap Walmart for your local big box store—Aldi, Tesco, Superstore, or Føtex are fair game!
