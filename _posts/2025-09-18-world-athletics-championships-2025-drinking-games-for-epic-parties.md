Ready to turn the World Athletics Championships 2025 into a legendary house party or a hilarious night in with your crew? Forget just watching—it's time to play along. At Drinking Dojo, we believe every moment is a chance for viral drinking games, wild dare challenges, and meme-worthy memories. So, grab your squad and let’s sprint, leap, and throw down with these party drinking games inspired by the biggest sporting showdown of the year.

## Drinking Games To Play During World Athletics Championships 2025

Whether you’re a die-hard track and field fan, or just looking for new house party ideas, these drinking challenges are built for hype, laughter, and a little friendly competition. Here’s how to join the games—dojo style.

### 1. The Sprint Sip-Off

**Materials:**  
- Drinks of choice  
- Timer (phone works fine)  
- TV or stream of the championships  
- Shot glasses  

**How To Play:**  
- Pick a short-distance track event (100m, 200m, or 400m).  
- As soon as the starting gun fires, everyone starts sipping their drink.  
- When the first runner crosses the finish line, stop sipping!  
- The slowest sipper must take a dare challenge (try a meme drinking game dare, or draw from your custom drinking game builder pack).

**Rules:**
- No chugging before the gun!  
- Spilling counts as a foul—take an extra sip if you do.

### 2. Jump Shot Challenge

**Materials:**  
- Drinks  
- A table and bottle caps or coins  
- Score sheet  

**How To Play:**  
- Each player gets three tries to bounce a cap into a cup (“high jump” style).  
- If you miss all three, take a sip. Make it in? You assign a dare to anyone else playing.  
- During actual high jump or pole vault events, double all drinks!

**Rules:**
- No leaning over the table—this is strictly by-the-book, unlike most meme drinking games.

### 3. Relay Race Roulette

**Materials:**  
- Drinks  
- Four solo cups per team  
- At least 4 players per team  

**How To Play:**  
- Divide into teams, each with four cups lined up.  
- First player drinks, flips their cup, then tags the next teammate.  
- First team to finish wins—losers must take on NSFW dares or pick from your custom drinking game builder.

**Rules:**
- All cups must be empty and flipped for your team to finish.  
- No skipping turns!

### 4. Medal Ceremony Dare Off

**Materials:**  
- Drinks  
- Notepad or your phone  
- Dare list (or use [Drinking Dojo’s dare challenges](https://drinkingdojo.com))  

**How To Play:**  
- Pick gold, silver, and bronze “medals” after each event (funniest commentary, wildest outfit, most epic fail).  
- Winners assign drinks or dares to others; losers must complete a dare or chug.

**Rules:**
- Get creative with your medals—think meme drinking games, not just athletic feats.  
- No repeats on dares until everyone’s gone once.
