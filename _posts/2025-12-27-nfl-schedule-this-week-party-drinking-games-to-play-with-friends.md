When the NFL schedule this week drops, you know what that means: snacks, rivalries, and a house full of friends ready to scream at the TV. But what if you could level up your Sunday Funday with some truly unforgettable party drinking games? Whether you’re die-hard about your team or just here for the halftime memes, we’ve got the perfect game plan to turn any NFL watch party into a Drinking Dojo-certified rager.

### Why NFL Games Make the Best Party Drinking Games

Let’s face it—nothing brings a crew together quite like football, drinks, and a bit of friendly chaos. The NFL schedule this week is packed with moments that are perfect for dare challenges, meme drinking games, and custom rules that keep everyone on their toes. It’s the ultimate excuse to try out new drinking games, test your luck, and maybe start a viral drinking game tradition of your own.

## The Ultimate NFL Drinking Game

Ready to kick off? Here’s everything you need to know to make your next game day unforgettable.

#### What You Need

- Your drink of choice (beer, seltzer, cocktails—you do you)
- A TV or stream showing the NFL game
- Friends (the more the merrier)
- Printed or digital list of rules (customize with our [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com))
- Optional: Props for dare challenges (think funny hats, random objects, or meme cutouts)

### How to Play

1. **Set the Rules:** Everyone agrees on the set of drinking triggers before kickoff. We’ve got a base set below, but feel free to add your own wild twists.
2. **Pour Up:** Everyone grabs their drinks and gets comfy.
3. **Play Along:** Watch the NFL action and follow the rules—drinks, dares, and meme moments included.
4. **Dare Challenges:** Whenever someone triggers a “dare,” they have to complete a NSFW (or SFW, up to you) challenge chosen by the group.
5. **Last Fan Standing:** Play until the final whistle or until there’s only one person who hasn’t been tripped up by the game’s chaos.

### NFL Drinking Game Rules

**Take a sip when:**
- Your team gets a first down
- There’s a flag on the play
- The announcer says “momentum”
- Someone eats on camera (hello, stadium hot dogs)
- A meme-worthy replay happens

**Take two sips when:**
- There’s a touchdown
- Someone in the room yells at the ref
- The coach throws a challenge flag

**Finish your drink or do a dare when:**
- There’s an interception or fumble by your team
- The halftime show gets weird (interpret as you like)
- Anyone in the room wears a rival jersey

**Bonus meme drinking game rule:**  
If a commercial goes viral on social media during the game, everyone takes a group selfie and posts it with your wildest meme face—then drinks!

### Pro Tips For House Party Ideas

- Mix in some couples drinking games for date-worthy double dares during the commercial breaks.
- Try our [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) to tailor your NFL rules to your squad’s sense of humor.
- Want to spice it up? Add some NSFW dares (just make sure everyone’s down for the challenge).
- Hosting a wedding party or big event at the same time? Combine NFL drinking games with wedding party games for the ultimate mashup.
