2. **Gather Your Friends**: Get your friends together, preferably those who can appreciate a bit of political humor and don’t mind a little friendly debate.

## How to Play

1. **Distribute the Bingo Cards**: Give each player their own bingo card. 

2. **Start the Event**: As the event begins, players should pay close attention to the action on screen.

3. **Drink and Mark**: Every time you hear a phrase or see an action that’s on your bingo card, take a sip of your drink and mark that square. If you hear a phrase that’s particularly outrageous, shout it out and take a larger gulp!

4. **Shout Bingo**: Once a player completes a row, column, or diagonal on their bingo card, they shout “Bingo!” and everyone must take a big drink in celebration of their victory!

5. **Bonus Rounds**: For added fun, create extra rules for certain phrases. For example:
   - If you hear “Make America Great Again,” everyone takes two sips.
   - If he mentions a celebrity, everyone raises their glass and takes a drink.
   - If he tweets during the event, everyone must finish their drink!
