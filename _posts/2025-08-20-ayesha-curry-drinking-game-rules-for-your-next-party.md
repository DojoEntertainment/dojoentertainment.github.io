## How To Play The Ayesha Curry Drinking Game

### The Basics

1. **Pick Your Content**
   - Stream any Ayesha Curry show, YouTube video, or interview. Bonus points if you pick something with Steph Curry making an appearance!

2. **Set The Rules**
   - Every time an event happens, everyone takes a sip, finishes their drink, or completes a dare challenge. The more creative, the better!

### Example Rules

- **Take One Sip When:**
  - Ayesha says “delicious”
  - Someone mentions Steph Curry or their kids
  - She laughs at her own joke
  - There’s a kitchen fail

- **Finish Your Drink If:**
  - Steph Curry walks in unexpectedly
  - Ayesha drops food on the floor
  - Anyone in the group starts debating their favorite Curry family member

- **Dare Challenges:**
  - If Ayesha starts dancing, the group must perform a meme-worthy dance or pull an NSFW dare from the pile
  - When a new ingredient is introduced, the last person to shout “Chef Curry!” does a dare

- **Wildcard:**
  - If you spot a viral meme moment, everyone must post their best meme face to Instagram—loser does a drinking challenge!
