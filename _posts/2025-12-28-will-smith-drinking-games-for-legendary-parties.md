You know a party’s heating up when someone drops a Will Smith reference—Fresh Prince, epic Oscars moment, or just a killer dance move. But what if you could turn all that Will Smith energy into the ultimate party drinking game? Welcome to the Drinking Dojo, where we take viral drinking games and meme drinking games to the next level!

Whether you’re pregaming for a house party, vibing at a wedding, or just looking for wild dare challenges, this Will Smith-inspired party drinking game is guaranteed to get everyone talking (and maybe even rapping). Ready to make your next night out unforgettable? Let’s get started.

### What You’ll Need

- Your favorite drinks (cocktails, beer, or mocktails for the non-drinkers)  
- A group of friends (the more, the wilder)  
- A screen with YouTube or Spotify (for the Will Smith playlist)  
- Printed or digital Will Smith meme cards (optional, but highly recommended)  
- Dare cards or access to our [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) for next-level NSFW dares  

### How To Play: The Will Smith Drinking Game

**Step 1: Set the Scene**  
Queue up a Will Smith playlist—think “Gettin’ Jiggy Wit It,” “Miami,” “Summertime,” and some classic Fresh Prince episodes in the background. Place your drinks within reach and gather in a circle.

**Step 2: The Rules**  
Whenever one of the following happens, everyone drinks:

- **Will Smith Song Drops**  
  Every time a Will Smith hit plays, everyone takes a sip. If someone can sing/rap a full verse, they can make someone else drink instead.

- **Fresh Prince Reference**  
  Someone quotes or references The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air? They assign a dare challenge from the pile. Failure to complete the dare = finish your drink!

- **Oscars Moment**  
  Someone mentions “the slap” or anything Oscars-related? Last person to tap their cheek takes two drinks.

- **Iconic Dance Moves**  
  Drop a Carlton or classic Will Smith dance move? Anyone who can’t mimic it must drink.

- **Movie Quote Challenge**  
  Name a Will Smith movie. The group has 10 seconds to shout out a quote from it. Whoever draws a blank, drinks.

**Bonus Rounds:**

- **NSFW Dares**  
  Feeling bold? Pull from the NSFW dare pile for next-level party drinking games. Think meme-worthy dares and viral drinking games that’ll have everyone in stitches.

- **Meme Master**  
  Share your best Will Smith meme. Weakest meme, as voted by the group, downs their drink.

### Perfect For Any Party

This Will Smith drinking game is the definition of house party ideas done right. It works for:

- **Wedding party games** (cue “Just the Two of Us” for the couples drinking games twist!)

- **Dorm nights, birthday bashes, or just a chill Friday night**
