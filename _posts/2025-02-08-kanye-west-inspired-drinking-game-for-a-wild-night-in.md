## How to Play

The game is simple and flexible, allowing you to adapt the rules based on your group's preferences. Here's how it goes

### Basic Rules

1. **Song Start Sip** Every time a new Kanye song begins, everyone takes a sip of their drink. It's a great way to kick off each track with a toast.
   
2. **Kanye Quote Chug** If someone in the group can quote a Kanye lyric before it plays, everyone else has to take a chug. If no one can quote it, they take a chug instead.

3. **Kanye's Name Drop** Whenever Kanye mentions his own name in a song, it's time for everyone to take a sip.

4. **Famous Friends** If a song features another famous artist, the last person to name them has to take two sips.

5. **Kanye Wisdom** For every Kanye song that has a profound or philosophical line, everyone discusses its meaning and takes a sip.

### Bonus Round

- **Kanye Dance Off** During your favorite Kanye track, have a dance-off. The person who gives the least enthusiastic performance has to finish their drink.

- **Fashion Moment** If Kanye mentions fashion or any of his brands, everyone must strike a pose and take a sip.
