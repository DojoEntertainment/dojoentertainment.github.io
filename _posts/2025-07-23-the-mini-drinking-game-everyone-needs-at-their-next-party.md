Ever found yourself at a party wanting to kick off the night with something quick, wild, and guaranteed to get the energy flowing? Meet **the mini**—the ultimate small-scale drinking game that packs a major punch. Whether you’re gearing up for a wedding party, a chill hangout, or just need a legendary pregame, the mini is your new go-to. It’s the perfect blend of dare challenges, viral drinking game vibes, and meme-worthy moments.

## What is The Mini?

The mini is a fast, flexible drinking game designed for 2–6 players. Unlike marathon party drinking games, the mini is all about quick rounds, bold dares, and laugh-out-loud drinking challenges. It’s easy to set up, endlessly customizable, and ideal for every occasion—from house parties to couples drinking games. If you’re tired of the same old routines, the mini brings back the thrill.

## What You’ll Need

- 1 small cup or shot glass (aka “the mini”)
- Your favorite drink (beer, wine, cocktails, or non-alcoholic for the brave)
- A coin or a die
- Dare cards or a custom dare list (try our [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com))
- Friends ready for some mayhem

## How To Play The Mini

### Set Up

1. Place the mini cup in the center of the group.
2. Shuffle your dare cards or open your custom dare challenge list.
3. Decide the order (youngest goes first, or let fate decide with a coin flip).

### Game Play

1. **On Your Turn:** Flip a coin or roll a die.
2. **Heads/Evens:** Pick up a dare card or select a dare from the list. Complete the dare or take a drink from the mini.
3. **Tails/Odds:** Pass the mini to the next player, who must take a shot or sip and face a meme-inspired challenge (think “do your best Fortnite dance” or “speak in emojis for one minute”).
4. **Wildcard:** If you land a special number (say, roll a 6), invent a new rule or dare—get creative! Maybe a quick NSFW dare or a twist inspired by viral drinking games.
5. Play keeps going until the mini is empty—or everyone’s done with dares.

## Mini Game Variations

- **Wedding Party Mini:** Customize your dare list with wedding-themed fun (e.g., “make a toast,” “reveal your worst date story”).
- **Couples Mini:** Add spicy tasks for pairs—perfect for breaking the ice or heating things up.
- **Themed Minis:** Try an inauguration day drinking game or a Fortnite drinking game twist—just swap in themed dares.

## Pro Tips For Next-Level Fun

- Use the [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) to craft meme drinking games that fit your group’s vibe.
- Don’t be afraid to go wild with dare challenges—just keep it safe and consensual.
- Make it social: Record the best moments for meme-worthy memories (and keep your socials popping).
