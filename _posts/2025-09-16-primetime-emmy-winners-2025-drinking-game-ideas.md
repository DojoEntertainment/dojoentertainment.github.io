## Emmy Winners 2025 Drinking Game Rules for an Unforgettable Party

Here’s how to play one of the most unforgettable party drinking games of the year:

### **Set Up Your Emmy Party Drinking Game**

1. **Nominee Draft:** Before the show starts, everyone picks 3 nominees they think will win (draw names from a hat if you want a twist).
2. **Pick Your Poison:** Decide on your drink of choice and get those glasses ready.
3. **Dare Deck:** Spice things up by prepping a few NSFW dares or meme-inspired challenges (need ideas? Use Drinking Dojo’s dare challenges tools).

### **How To Play This Viral Drinking Game**

**Take a Sip When:**
- Someone thanks their pet, partner, or “the fans.”
- A winner’s speech gets cut off by music.
- An awkward presenter moment happens (we all know it will).
- There’s a standing ovation.

**Take Two Sips If:**
- Your chosen nominee wins their category.
- Someone references a viral TV moment or meme.

**Finish Your Drink If:**
- There’s a surprise upset for Best Drama or Comedy.
- An acceptance speech gets emotional enough to make someone in the room tear up.

**Dare Challenges:**
After every commercial break, the person with the fewest correct winner predictions draws a dare from the meme drinking games pack (think: “Send a Snapchat in your best celeb voice” or “Do a TikTok dance on the spot”).
