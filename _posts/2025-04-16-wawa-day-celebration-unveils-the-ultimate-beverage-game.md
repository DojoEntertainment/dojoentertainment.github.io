Celebrate Wawa Day with a splash of fun and camaraderie by diving into a unique drinking game experience. Inspired by the annual celebration of the beloved convenience store chain, this game is perfect for those looking to add a twist of excitement to their gatherings. Whether you're a Wawa enthusiast or just someone who loves a good time, this game will certainly elevate your festivities.

### Introduction

Wawa Day is more than just a celebration of great coffee and hoagies; it's an event that brings people together in the spirit of joy and community. What better way to honor this tradition than with a game that combines laughter, competition, and, of course, beverages? Let's delve into the rules, materials, and gameplay to ensure your Wawa Day is unforgettable.

### Materials Needed

- A selection of beverages (alcoholic or non-alcoholic, depending on your preference)
- Plastic cups
- A deck of cards
- A table for setting up the game

### How to Play

#### Setting Up

1. **Arrange the Table**: Place the plastic cups in a circle around the table. Fill each cup with a different beverage, symbolizing the diverse offerings at Wawa.

2. **Shuffle the Deck**: Shuffle the deck of cards and place it face down in the center of the table.

#### Game Rules

1. **Drawing Cards**: Players take turns drawing a card from the deck. Each card has a specific action associated with it:

   - **Ace**: "Wawa Cheer" - Everyone raises their cup and takes a sip, celebrating Wawa Day.
   - **2-4**: "Switcheroo" - The player chooses two people to swap their drinks.
   - **5-7**: "Taste Test" - The player must take a sip from every other cup on the table.
   - **8-10**: "Wawa Trivia" - Ask a Wawa-related trivia question. The first person to answer correctly assigns a sip to a player of their choice.
   - **Jack**: "Wawa Run" - The player must finish their drink and refill it with a new beverage from the selection.
   - **Queen**: "Story Time" - Share your favorite Wawa memory or create a fictional tale involving the store. The group votes on the best story, and the winner assigns three sips.
   - **King**: "King's Command" - Make a rule that everyone must follow for the rest of the game (e.g., no using first names).

2. **Winning the Game**: The game continues until all the cards are drawn. The player with the fewest sips taken throughout the game is declared the Wawa Day Champion, earning the right to create a new rule for the next game.

### Conclusion

Wawa Day is all about embracing community spirit and enjoying good company. This drinking game not only adds an element of fun to your celebration but also pays homage to the beloved Wawa culture.
