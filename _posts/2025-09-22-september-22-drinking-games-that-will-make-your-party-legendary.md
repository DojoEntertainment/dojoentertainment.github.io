When September 22 rolls around, you don’t need a reason to throw a wild party—just the right drinking games, a crew ready for dare challenges, and maybe a meme or two to keep things spicy. Whether you’re chilling in a dorm, hosting a house party, or kicking off a wedding weekend, September 22 is the perfect excuse to gather your mates and turn an ordinary night into an unforgettable one.

Ready to level up your party drinking games? Here’s how to make September 22 the most talked-about night of the year.

## Why September 22 Is Prime Time for Drinking Games in the US, UK, Canada, Australia, and Denmark

Let’s be real: early fall hits different. It’s not quite pumpkin spice season, but the summer vibes haven’t faded. September 22 is smack in the middle of everything, making it the ultimate date for viral drinking games and next-level dares. So, whether you’re in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, or Denmark, it’s time to assemble your squad and get the drinks (responsibly) flowing.

## The Ultimate September 22 Party Drinking Games Night

We’ve handpicked three epic party drinking games to get the good times rolling. Each one is easy to set up, hilarious, and designed for max chaos—just the way Drinking Dojo likes it.

### 1. Meme Challenge Showdown

**Perfect for:** Groups who speak fluent meme  
**Materials:** Printed memes or a meme generator on your phone, drinks

**Rules:**
- Everyone draws or is assigned a meme.
- Players must come up with a drinking dare that matches the energy of their meme—think NSFW dares, silly impressions, or dance-offs.
- The group votes on whose dare is the most “on-brand” for their meme. Loser takes a drink, winner assigns a drink.

**Why it rocks:** It’s basically a meme drinking game come to life, and the dares get funnier (and wilder) as the night goes on.

### 2. September 22 Dare Roulette

**Perfect for:** People who love drinking challenges  
**Materials:** A cup, slips of paper, pen, drinks

**Rules:**
- Everyone writes down a dare challenge and tosses it in the cup.
- On your turn, pick a dare. If you complete it, you give out drinks. If you refuse, you drink.
- Add a few “mystery” dares for extra chaos—think “speak in an accent for 10 minutes” or “send a cringe selfie to your group chat.”

**Why it rocks:** No two rounds are the same, and the possibilities are endless—especially if you sneak in some NSFW dares.

### 3. Custom Drinking Game Builder

**Perfect for:** Creative crews who want a personalized experience  
**Materials:** [Drinking Dojo’s custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com), drinks

**How to play:**
- Jump onto the Drinking Dojo site and use the custom builder to whip up your own September 22 drinking game.
- Add inside jokes, dares, and meme-worthy challenges.
- Play as a group and keep score—loser has to post an embarrassing Insta story.

**Why it rocks:** You get a one-of-a-kind party drinking game that’s all about your crew (and you can save it for next year).

## Pro Tips for Making September 22 Unforgettable

- **Mix in viral drinking games** like the Fortnite drinking game or create an inauguration day drinking game or election day drinking game if you’re celebrating something special.
- Rotate in couples drinking games for the romantics.
- Always have water and snacks on hand—hydrated legends party longer.
- Play responsibly and know your limits. The goal is wild, not regrettable.
