### How to Play: The Rugby Showdown Drinking Game

This drinking game is designed for any rugby match, but it’s especially epic for Australia vs British & Irish Lions clashes. Here’s how to make every try, scrum, and penalty even more thrilling.

#### **Basic Rules**

1. **Split Into Teams:**  
   Divide the room into two squads — Team Australia and Team Lions. If you’ve got a mixed crowd, let everyone choose their allegiance (or assign teams with a coin flip).

2. **Assign Drinks:**  
   Each team picks a signature drink (e.g., Aussie beer vs. British cider), or just stick with what you love.

3. **Game On:**  
   Watch the match together and follow these rules. The more unpredictable the match, the wilder the party gets.

#### **Drinking Game Rules**

- **Every Try:**  
  All opposing team members take 2 sips.

- **Conversion Missed:**  
  Everyone drinks!

- **Yellow Card:**  
  Do a dare challenge picked at random. (Get NSFW dares in the mix if you’re feeling brave!)

- **Red Card:**  
  Down your drink or complete a wedding party game-style group dare (think “best haka dance” or “team singalong”).

- **Penalty Kick Awarded:**  
  Last person to raise their glass drinks.

- **Drop Goal:**  
  Team of the scorer nominates someone on the opposing team to finish their drink.

- **Commentator Memes:**  
  If the commentator says “massive hit,” “unbelievable,” or “that’s rugby,” all take a group sip.

- **Injury Time:**  
  While the physio is on the field, everyone shares a drinking challenge or tells a wild rugby story.

#### **Bonus Dare Challenges**
