- **Drinks** of your choice
- **Friends** ready to have fun

### How to Play

#### Setup

1. **Choose a Wordle Master:** Each round, one person will act as the Wordle Master. This person will set up the Wordle game and be the sole player interacting with the device.
   
2. **Gather the Players:** The rest of the group are the Guessers, who will collaboratively suggest words and make guesses.

3. **Prepare the Drinks:** Each person should have their drink of choice within reach.

#### Game Rules

1. **Start the Game:** The Wordle Master opens the game on their device, ready to receive input from the Guessers.

2. **Make a Guess:** The Guessers collectively decide on a five-letter word to guess. The Wordle Master types it into the game.

3. **Drink for Mistakes:** For each incorrect letter (gray), all Guessers take a sip of their drink. If a letter is correct but in the wrong position (yellow), only the person who suggested that word takes a sip. If a letter is correct and in the right position (green), no one drinks.

4. **Celebrate Success:** If the word is guessed correctly before the six attempts are up, all players raise their glasses and take a celebratory sip.

5. **Consequence for Failures:** If the word is not guessed within the given attempts, the Wordle Master chooses a fun consequence for all Guessers, such as telling a joke or doing a silly dance.

6. **Rotate Roles:** Rotate the role of Wordle Master after each round to give everyone a chance to lead the game.

### Tips for a Great Game Night

- **Pace Yourself:** Remember, the goal is fun, not inebriation. Encourage responsible drinking.
- **Encourage Creativity:** Let players suggest wild and creative words. It adds to the fun and might lead to unexpected victories.
- **Mix It Up:** Challenge your friends with themed rounds, like only using animal names or words starting with a specific letter.
