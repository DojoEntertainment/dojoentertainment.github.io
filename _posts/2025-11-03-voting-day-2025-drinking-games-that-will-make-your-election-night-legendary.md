Voting Day 2025 is coming up fast, and you know what that means — it’s the perfect excuse to gather your crew, order some food, and turn election updates into an epic party drinking game night. Whether you’re hyped about the results, just here for the memes, or love a good dare challenge, Drinking Dojo has the ultimate guide to making your election day unforgettable.

## Why Election Day Needs Drinking Games

Let’s be honest, watching election coverage can be a rollercoaster. But with the right party drinking games, you turn every awkward pause, wild news update, and viral meme into an excuse to cheer, sip, and laugh with your friends. From couples drinking games to NSFW dares (if your group’s up for it), a custom drinking game builder takes things to the next level.

Ready to make your Voting Day 2025 the most memorable one yet? Here’s how.

## How To Play: The Ultimate Election Day Drinking Game

### What You’ll Need
- Your favorite drinks (beer, cocktails, seltzers, or mocktails — you do you)
- A TV, laptop, or phone tuned to election coverage
- Drinking Dojo’s [Custom Drinking Game Builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) or print out our rule cards
- Optional: Blank paper for DIY meme challenges, dare cards, and scorekeeping

### The Rules
Mix and match these rules, or use the custom drinking game builder to create the perfect set for your crew. Here’s a starter pack to get you going:

#### Sip If:
- A candidate says “let me be clear”
- The camera cuts to a crowd shot
- Someone mentions “record turnout”
- There’s a technical glitch or awkward silence

#### Take Two Drinks If:
- A meme about the election goes viral in your group chat
- Your state or region is called live on air
- Someone in the room changes their prediction

#### Dare Challenges:
- The last person to spot a new meme must draw an NSFW dare from the pile
- If a reporter stumbles over words, the group votes on who does a wedding party game dare (think: toast to the candidates, or make up a campaign slogan in 10 seconds)

#### Shot or Big Sip If:
- Major upset or surprise result is announced
- Your favorite candidate wins (or loses) your home state/country

#### Wild Card Meme Drinking Games:
- When a viral meme pops up, everyone tries to recreate it. Best effort picks someone to finish their drink.
- If a trending hashtag appears on screen, shout it out or take a penalty drink

## Tips For Epic Voting Day Drinking Challenges

- **Regional twist:** Add rules for your country (like “sip every time someone mentions swing states” in the US, or “drink when someone mispronounces a UK party leader’s name”).
