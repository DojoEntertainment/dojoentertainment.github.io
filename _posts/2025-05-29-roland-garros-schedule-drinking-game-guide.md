If you’re looking for a wild new way to spice up your **party drinking games**, why not turn the Roland Garros schedule into your next **viral drinking game**? Whether you’re a tennis fanatic or just love a good **dare challenge**, this drinking game serves up a grand slam of fun, memes, and unforgettable moments—perfect for **house party ideas**, **wedding party games**, or that classic dorm room hangout.

Let’s break down how to play, what you need, and the best rules to keep things rolling from the first serve to match point.

### What You’ll Need

- The Roland Garros schedule (find it online or on TV!)
- Your favorite drinks (beer, cocktails, seltzers—your choice)
- Cups for each player
- Printed or digital list of dares (bonus: add some **NSFW dares** for late-night rounds)
- Friends who are ready for epic **drinking challenges**

### How To Play the Roland Garros Schedule Drinking Game

#### 1. **Set Up Your Squad**

Gather your crew—this game works best with 3 to 8 players. Grab the Roland Garros schedule and pick a match to watch together (or follow live stats if you can’t stream).

#### 2. **Pick Your Players**

Assign each person a player in the match—or, for bigger groups, split into Team A and Team B based on the match sides. If you’re rooting for a specific player, rep them loud and proud.

#### 3. **Game Rules**

Here’s where the **party drinking games** magic happens. Every time one of these events pops up during the match, drink up or take on a dare:

- **Ace Served**: Everyone cheers and takes a sip.
- **Double Fault**: Last person to shout “Oops!” does a dare (think **meme drinking games** style, like swapping shirts or texting a random emoji).
- **Break Point Won**: Team of the winning player hands out 2 drinks.
- **Set Point Saved**: Everyone finishes what’s in their cup.
- **Player Challenges a Call**: Group votes—if the call is overturned, those who guessed wrong drink. If it stands, those who guessed right drink.
- **Commentator Mentions “Clay”**: All players clink glasses and take a drink.
- **Any Player Argues With Umpire**: Dare challenge time—draw a random dare and complete it.
