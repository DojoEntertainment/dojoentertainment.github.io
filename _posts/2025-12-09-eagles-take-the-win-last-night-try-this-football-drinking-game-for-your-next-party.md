So, the Eagles snagged the W last night—what a showdown! Whether you’re still buzzing from the big plays or just using the score as an excuse to gather your crew, it’s the perfect time to revamp your party drinking games. At Drinking Dojo, we believe every game day (or post-game) deserves a little chaos, a few dare challenges, and a whole lot of laughter. Ready to bring the energy from the stadium straight to your living room? Let’s kick off the ultimate football drinking game—customized for fans across the US, UK, Canada, Australia, and Denmark.

## Why Football Drinking Games Are a Must for Your Next Watch Party

Football brings people together, but let’s be real: sometimes, the commercials and halftime lulls could use a boost. That’s where party drinking games and meme drinking games come in. Whether you’re cheering your team to victory or just here for the snacks, a good drinking challenge levels up the fun and keeps everyone hyped from kickoff to the final whistle.

## The Ultimate Football Drinking Game

Here’s how to turn last night’s football drama into tonight’s wildest pregame.

### What You’ll Need
- Drinks of choice (beer, seltzer, cocktails—whatever fits your vibe)
- A TV or streaming device for the game (or highlights)
- Pens and paper (or your phone) for tracking dares and points
- Optional: A custom drinking game builder from [Drinking Dojo](https://drinkingdojo.com) for the ultimate personalized experience

### How To Play

**Set Up:**
- Gather your squad and split into two teams—each supporting a different side (Eagles fans vs. everyone else, for example).
- Print or jot down the rules below, or use our custom drinking game builder to make it even more chaotic.

**Rules:**

1. **First Down Fizz:** Every time your team gets a first down, everyone on the other team takes a sip.
2. **Touchdown Toast:** When your team scores a touchdown, all opposing fans take a big gulp. If it’s a defensive touchdown, double it.
3. **Flag on the Play:** If a penalty is called, last person to yell “Ref, open your eyes!” takes a drink.
4. **Field Goal Fumble:** Missed field goal? Both teams drink. Nailed it? Only the other side drinks.
5. **Epic Meme Moment:** If the broadcast shows a viral meme or a wild fan in the stands, everyone does a dare challenge—think NSFW dares if you’re feeling spicy, or classic truth-or-dare for more chill vibes.
6. **Halftime Dare-Off:** At halftime, each team picks a player to complete a dare challenge chosen by the other side.
7. **Final Score Showdown:** At the end of the game, the losing team must perform a dare chosen by the winners (bonus points for creativity—think wedding party games or even a Fortnite drinking game mashup).

### Pro Tips for a Legendary Night

- Make it your own: Use our custom drinking game builder to add inside jokes or wild house party ideas.
- Keep it responsible: Know your limits and make sure everyone gets home safe.
- Bring the memes: Add meme drinking games challenges for bonus laughs—who can pull off the best touchdown dance?
