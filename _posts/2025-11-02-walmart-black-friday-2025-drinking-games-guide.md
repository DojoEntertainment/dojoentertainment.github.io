Black Friday at Walmart is basically a sport—shoppers darting through aisles, hunting down deals, and dodging carts like Olympic athletes. But what if you could turn Walmart Black Friday 2025 into the wildest party drinking game night of the year? Whether you're pregaming before the chaos or throwing a house party for your deal-hunting crew, we've got the ultimate party drinking games, dares, and meme-worthy challenges to make your Black Friday unforgettable.

## Turn Black Friday Into a Legendary Party Drinking Game

You don’t need to fight for a 4K TV to feel the adrenaline. With these viral drinking games inspired by the madness of Walmart Black Friday 2025, you’ll bring the shopping hype home—minus the risk of getting trampled in the electronics aisle.

### What You Need

- Your beverage(s) of choice (go wild or keep it chill)
- Friends who love a challenge
- A TV or livestream of Black Friday deals (optional but hilarious)
- Dare cards, meme drinking games, or a custom drinking game builder (check out [Drinking Dojo’s custom tools](https://drinkingdojo.com))

## The Walmart Black Friday Drinking Game

### Game Setup

1. **Divide into Teams:** Compete as shoppers, staff, or lone wolves—your call.
2. **Create Dare Challenges:** Use our custom drinking game builder to add spicy dares, NSFW dares, or classic meme drinking games.
3. **Deal or Drink:** Every time a wild deal or outrageous moment pops up, it's time to drink.

### Basic Rules

- **Spot the Craziness:**  
  - Shopper runs = everyone takes a sip.
  - Someone drops something = last person to notice drinks.
  - TV deal under $100 = everyone does a dare.
- **Meme Mayhem:**  
  - If you spot a viral meme moment (think matching pajamas, someone in a turkey suit, or wild TikTok dance), assign a shot to someone.
- **Checkout Line Challenge:**  
  - Every time the checkout line is mentioned or shown, everyone does a group toast and drinks.
- **Doorbuster Dash:**  
  - When a major doorbuster deal is announced, the first person to shout “WALMART!” picks someone to do a dare challenge.

### Dare Challenges

Want to level up? Insert dare challenges from Drinking Dojo’s packs or create your own with our custom drinking game builder. Examples:

- Imitate a shopping cart crash (loser finishes their drink).
- Do your best Black Friday sales pitch in under 30 seconds.
- NSFW dare: Text your ex “Happy Black Friday, I still miss your discounts.”

## Bonus Party Drinking Game Ideas

If the Black Friday chaos isn’t enough, try themed drinking challenges like:

- **Wedding party games**: Mix up teams, newlyweds vs. singles.
- **Couples drinking games**: Compete to see who spots the best deals.
- **House party ideas**: Set up “aisles” with different drinking stations.

## Pro Tips for a Legendary Black Friday Game Night

- Stay hydrated—mix water rounds between those savage dares.
- Customize your meme drinking games with trending Black Friday memes.
- Use our custom drinking game builder for a personalized experience that’ll go viral in your group chat.
