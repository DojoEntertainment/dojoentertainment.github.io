- The camera pans to a fan in crazy costume  

**Take two sips if:**  
- There’s a dropped catch  
- A player argues with the umpire  
- Someone mentions the weather (classic UK chat)  

**Finish your drink if:**  
- There’s a hat-trick  
- A player hits 100 runs (century)  
- The match goes to a Super Over  

### Dare Challenges For Extra Spice

Want to take it up a notch? Add these dare challenges every time a wicket falls:

- **NSFW dares** (if you’re feeling wild and your crew’s cool with it)  
- Impersonate a commentator for five minutes  
- Attempt your best cricket bat swing—without breaking anything  
- Post a meme-worthy selfie to your group chat
