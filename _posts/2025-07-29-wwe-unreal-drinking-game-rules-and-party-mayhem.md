Ready to take your next hangout from “meh” to “memorable mayhem”? Enter WWE Unreal, the drinking game that body-slams boring nights and tag-teams your crew into unforgettable chaos! Whether you’re pregaming for a big night out, vibing at a house party, or just feel like spicing up your next meme drinking games marathon, WWE Unreal packs all the dare challenges and party drinking games energy you crave.

### What Is WWE Unreal?

WWE Unreal is the wildest twist on classic drinking games, inspired by the over-the-top drama of wrestling legends. It’s about getting rowdy, flexing your best smack-talk, and daring your mates to step into the ring—no actual wrestling moves required (please leave the suplexes to the pros).

### What You Need

- A group of party animals (3+ players is best)
- Your favorite drinks (beer, seltzer, cocktails—whatever fuels your party)
- A sturdy table or living room “ring”
- A WWE Unreal challenge pack from Drinking Dojo (optional for extra dare challenges and meme drinking games)
- Props for fun: fake championship belt, sunglasses, headbands, or even a makeshift microphone

### How To Play WWE Unreal

#### Step 1: Set the Stage

- Form a circle or gather around your “ring.”
- Put the championship belt or prop in the center—this is what everyone’s fighting for.

#### Step 2: Assign Personas

- Each player picks a wrestling persona or meme-inspired alter ego. (Bonus points for ridiculous accents and costumes!)

#### Step 3: Choose a Referee

- The Referee keeps the peace, calls out fouls, and reads out dare challenges—rotate this role every round.

#### Step 4: The Game Begins

1. **Promo Round:**  
   Go around the circle. Each player has 30 seconds to cut a wild wrestling promo (trash talk, hype up your “finishing move,” roast the competition).  
   - Best promo (voted by the group) gives out 2 drinks.
   - Worst promo takes 2 drinks.

2. **Challenge Cards:**  
   Draw from your WWE Unreal drinking game cards or use the [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) to create personalized dare challenges. Examples include:
   - “Perform the People’s Elbow on a pillow. Fail = drink 3.”
   - “Call out a tag team and do a double dare.”
   - “Create a viral meme on your phone in 60 seconds. Best meme gives out 3 drinks.”

3. **Rumble Time:**  
   Every so often, the Referee shouts “Royal Rumble!” Everyone must chug their drink for 10 seconds. Last to finish takes an extra dare.

4. **Title Match:**  
   At any point, a player can challenge another for the championship belt.  
   - The challenger and champion face off in a dare challenge or quick meme contest.
   - Loser takes 2 drinks, winner gets the belt (and brags).

#### Step 5: NSFW and Themed Rounds (Optional)

- Add NSFW dares for grown-up spice (think: wedding party games or couples drinking games).
- Themed rounds: Try a Fortnite drinking game twist or Election Day drinking game challenges for bonus chaos.

### Epic Tips for an Unreal Night

- Play your persona to the max—bring the drama!
- Use viral drinking games dares from Drinking Dojo to keep things fresh.
- Snap and share meme-worthy moments (but remember, what happens in the ring… might end up on someone’s story).
