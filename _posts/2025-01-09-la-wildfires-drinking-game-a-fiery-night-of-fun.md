---


The intensity and unpredictability of wildfires have inspired a drinking game that's just as wild and thrilling. Welcome to the La Wildfires Drinking Game - a fun and engaging way to ignite your night with friends. Gather around safely indoors and prepare for a memorable evening.

## Materials Needed

- A group of friends (4-8 players recommended)
- A variety of drinks (alcoholic or non-alcoholic)
- A deck of cards
- A timer or stopwatch
- A designated fire marshal (explained below)

## How to Play

The La Wildfires Drinking Game is designed to keep you on your toes, much like the unpredictable nature of an actual wildfire. Here's how to play

### Setting Up

1. **Designate a Fire Marshal**: Choose one player to be the Fire Marshal. This person is responsible for keeping track of time and enforcing the rules.

2. **Prepare the Cards**: Shuffle the deck of cards and place it in the center of the table.

3. **Set the Timer**: The Fire Marshal sets a timer for 10-minute intervals to keep the game moving.

### Game Rules

1. **Draw a Card**: Players take turns drawing a card from the deck and follow the instructions based on the card drawn.

2. **Card Instructions**:
   - **Hearts**: Pass the Heat - Choose another player to take a drink.
   - **Diamonds**: Spark a Story - Share a personal story. Everyone else drinks if the story involves a risky or fiery situation.
   - **Clubs**: Controlled Burn - Everyone drinks a small amount.
   - **Spades**: Firestorm - All players must finish their drink.

3. **Wildfire Alert**: Every 10 minutes, the Fire Marshal calls a Wildfire Alert. During this alert, all players must swap drinks with the person to their left and take a drink.

4. **Extinguish the Flames**: If a player draws a Joker, the round ends immediately. All players must finish their current drink to extinguish the flames and start a new round.

5. **Fire Marshal's Call**: The Fire Marshal can call a Fire Drill at any time. During a Fire Drill, players must stand up, spin in a circle, and sit back down. The last person to sit must drink.

### Ending the Game

The game ends when the deck runs out of cards or when players decide they have had enough fun for the night. Remember, the goal is to enjoy responsibly and ensure everyone has a good time.

## Tips for a Safe and Enjoyable Game

- Always have water available for players to stay hydrated.
- Encourage players to drink responsibly and know their limits.
- Ensure a safe environment and never play near open flames or dangerous areas.
