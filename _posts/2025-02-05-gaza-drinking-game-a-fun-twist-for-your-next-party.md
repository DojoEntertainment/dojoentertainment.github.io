Are you ready to spice up your next party with a new and exciting drinking game? Say hello to the Gaza Drinking Game - a fun and engaging way to enjoy time with friends. Inspired by the strategic elements of the beloved game ''Gaza'' this drinking game combines luck, strategy, and a good dose of humor. Gather your friends, grab your drinks, and get ready for a night of laughter and competition.

## What You'll Need

To play the Gaza Drinking Game you'll need the following items

- A deck of cards
- A set of dice
- Drinks of choice for all players
- A group of enthusiastic friends

## How to Play

The objective of the Gaza Drinking Game is to be the last player standing without having consumed too many drinks. The game is played in rounds and each round consists of two phases: the Card Phase and the Dice Phase.

### Card Phase

1. Shuffle the deck of cards and place it in the center of the group.
2. Each player draws a card from the deck in turn.
3. The card drawn determines the action to be taken. Here's a quick guide

   - **Ace**: Everyone drinks.
   - **King**: You choose a player to drink.
   - **Queen**: Ladies drink.
   - **Jack**: Gents drink.
   - **Number Cards (2-10)**: The player with the highest card drinks.

### Dice Phase

1. After the Card Phase is complete all players roll the dice simultaneously.
2. The player with the lowest roll must drink.
3. If there's a tie both players involved in the tie drink.

## Special Rules

- **Double Trouble**: If a player rolls a double (two dice showing the same number) they can choose another player to drink instead of themselves.
- **Gaza Power**: Drawing a Joker gives you the power to make any player of your choice drink twice.

## Winning the Game

The game continues in rounds until a player feels they've reached their limit or until the group decides to end it. The last person to remain standing without bowing out of the game is declared the winner of the Gaza Drinking Game.

## Tips for a Great Game Night

- Ensure everyone drinks responsibly and knows their limits.
- Have plenty of water and snacks available to keep the energy up.
- Mix up the drinks with some non-alcoholic options for variety.
