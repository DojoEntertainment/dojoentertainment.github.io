### Introduction

Are you a fan of Morgan Wallen's music and looking for a fun way to enjoy his hits with friends? Look no further! We've crafted a Morgan Wallen-inspired party game that combines the thrill of drinking games with the catchy tunes of one of country music's biggest stars. Gather your friends, pour your favorite drinks, and get ready to have a blast with this musical twist on classic drinking games.

### Materials Needed

- A playlist of Morgan Wallen songs
- A music streaming device or app
- Drinks of choice (beer, cocktails, or non-alcoholic beverages)
- Cups
- A timer or stopwatch

### Game Rules

**Setup:**

1. Create a playlist with your favorite Morgan Wallen songs. You can use popular streaming services like [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com) or [Apple Music](https://www.apple.com/apple-music/).
2. Arrange seating to form a circle, ensuring everyone has easy access to their drink.

**How to Play:**

1. **Song Selection:** Start by playing a Morgan Wallen song from your playlist. The game begins as soon as the music starts.

2. **Drink Triggers:** Each player takes a sip of their drink whenever one of the following occurs during a song:
   - The words "whiskey," "beer," or "drunk" are mentioned.
   - Morgan Wallen's signature drawl stretches a word.
   - A guitar solo kicks in.
   - Someone in the room sings along.

3. **Chorus Challenge:** During the chorus of each song, players must raise their drinks and toast to Morgan Wallen. Anyone who forgets to toast must take an extra sip.

4. **Lyric Roulette:** At the start of each song, one player is randomly chosen to predict a phrase or word that will be repeated. If their prediction is correct, they get to assign two sips to another player.

5. **Song Switch:** Every 10 minutes, switch to a different Morgan Wallen song. This keeps the game dynamic and ensures everyone hears a variety of tracks.

### Safety and Fun

Remember, the goal is to have fun, so please drink responsibly. Ensure everyone is of legal drinking age and has a safe way to get home. You can always modify the game to include non-alcoholic drinks or take breaks between rounds.
