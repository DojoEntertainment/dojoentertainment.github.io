When you mix viral drinking games with a touch of wordplay, you get a party classic in the making. Enter the Wordle Hint Drinking Game—a fresh way to turn your love for puzzle-solving and dare challenges into an epic night of laughs, shots, and meme-worthy moments. If you’re searching for wild drinking games that spark friendly chaos, this one’s a must for your next pregame, wedding party, or house party with friends.

## What Is the Wordle Hint Drinking Game?

Inspired by the addictive guessing game, this party drinking game puts a boozy spin on brainpower and clever clues. Whether you’re vibing in a dorm or looking for house party ideas in Sydney or Toronto, it’s easy to play, totally customizable, and guaranteed to get everyone involved.

## What You Need

- A device with access to [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) (or use a custom word generator)
- Drinks of your choice (beer, cocktails, or mocktails—your call)
- A group of 3+ players
- Dare challenges or NSFW dares (optional, for extra spice)
- Pen and paper (for keeping score or writing dares)

## How To Play the Wordle Hint Drinking Game

1. **Set Up the Game**
   - Pick one person each round to be the “Word Master.” The Word Master thinks of a five-letter word (just like in the OG Wordle) and writes it down secretly.
   - The rest are the Guessers.

2. **Take Turns Guessing**
   - Each Guesser takes a turn to guess a five-letter word.
   - The Word Master gives clues (just like Wordle hints):  
     - Letter in the right spot = green  
     - Letter in the word but wrong spot = yellow  
     - Letter not in the word = gray

3. **Bring On the Drinks**
   - Wrong guess? Take a sip.
   - No right letters at all? Take a shot or complete a dare challenge from the custom drinking game builder.
   - Guess a word with an NSFW theme? That player chooses someone to drink.
   - If someone guesses the word in under three tries, they hand out drinks to two players of their choice.

4. **Level Up With Dare Challenges**
   - Add a twist: For every round, the person who gets the least correct letters pulls a random dare (get wild with meme drinking games or custom dares from [Drinking Dojo](https://drinkingdojo.com)).
   - Turn up the heat with viral drinking games themes—think Fortnite drinking game words, wedding party games, or even election day drinking game prompts for adults who love a laugh.

5. **Switch It Up**
   - Rotate the Word Master after each round.
   - Keep score if you want to crown a winner (and loser) at the end—loser takes a final dare!
