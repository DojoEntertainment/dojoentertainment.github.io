Ready to spice up your playoff watch party? The NFL scores playoff picture is heating up, and there’s no better excuse to gather your crew, crack open some cold ones, and turn each touchdown into a legendary memory. Whether you’re vibing in a student flat in the UK, hosting a house party in Toronto, or repping your favorite team Down Under, Drinking Dojo has the ultimate lineup of party drinking games to keep the energy wild and the dares unforgettable.

Forget just yelling at the TV—let’s make every pass, fumble, and field goal part of your drinking game ritual.

## What You Need for Your NFL Playoff Drinking Games

- Your favorite drinks (beer, cocktails, or non-alcoholic—no judgment)
- A TV or streaming setup for the big game
- NFL playoff bracket or live scores app (for the full effect)
- Shot glasses, cups, and maybe a whistle for the ref
- Daring spirit and maybe, just maybe, a meme or two

## NFL Scores Playoff Picture Drinking Game Rules for Epic Parties

Here’s how to turn the playoff madness into a drinking challenge that’ll be talked about all offseason:

### Basic Rules of Party Drinking Games

- **Pick Your Team:** Before kickoff, everyone picks a team to root for. If your team scores, you hand out drinks. If the other team scores, you take a drink.
- **Touchdown Toast:** Every touchdown? Everyone drinks. The person whose team scored gets to dare someone else to do a meme-worthy challenge (think: TikTok dance or NSFW dares if everyone’s cool with it).
- **Turnover Trouble:** When there’s a fumble or interception, the last person to raise their drink has to do a dare from the Drinking Dojo custom drinking game builder.
- **Field Goal Fizz:** Field goals mean everyone sips, but if the kicker misses, the football “expert” in the group owes a shot.
- **Overtime Overload:** If the game goes to OT, it’s time for a round of viral drinking games—think flip cup, kings, or even a Fortnite drinking game for a meme crossover.

## Bonus Dare Challenges to Amp Up Your Party Drinking Games

Make it rowdier with these party drinking game challenges:

- **Meme Drinking Game:** When a meme-able moment happens on TV (awkward fan, wild coach reaction), everyone shares their best meme and the worst one drinks.
- **Couples Drinking Games:** Watching with your S.O.? Every time the commentators mention “momentum,” swap drinks or do a couples dare.
- **Wedding Party Games:** Got a football-loving wedding crowd? Use the playoff picture as inspiration for custom dares at the reception—each score triggers a dance-off or dare challenge.
