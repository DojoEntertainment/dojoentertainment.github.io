Sick of the same old house party ideas? It’s time to crank up the chaos and get your squad laughing with flu-themed drinking games. No, we’re not talking about catching an actual bug—just bringing that viral energy to your next pregame, wedding rager, or house party. Whether you’re into dare challenges, meme drinking games, or custom drinking game builders, these flu-inspired party drinking games will have your crew feeling anything but under the weather.

## What You Need

Before you start, stock up on:
- Your favorite drinks (beer, seltzers, cocktails—whatever gets you feeling lively)
- Cups or shot glasses
- A deck of cards (optional for custom rules)
- Blank paper or your phone for tracking dares and points
- A group of party animals ready for some viral drinking games

## Flu Frenzy: The Party Drinking Game

Ready to spread some fun? Here’s how to play the Flu Frenzy drinking game—perfect for kicking off a wild night with drinking challenges and meme-worthy dares.

### How to Play

1. **Set the Mood**  
   Gather everyone in a circle. Pour your first round. Pick one person to start as “Patient Zero.”

2. **Patient Zero’s Dare**  
   Patient Zero picks a dare challenge from a bowl (or use the [Drinking Dojo custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) for next-level dares). They must complete the dare or take a drink.

3. **Spread the Fun**  
   After completing their dare, Patient Zero points to someone else and gives them a “symptom” (a silly rule or action, like “every time you cough, take a sip” or “speak in a robot voice for the next round”).

4. **Viral Rounds**  
   Each new “infected” player draws a dare, performs it, and then passes along a new symptom to another player. Symptoms stack—if you have multiple, you have to follow them all until the game ends.

5. **Outbreaks**  
   If someone fails a dare or forgets to follow a symptom, they drink twice. For an extra twist, add a meme drinking game element: shout out a trending meme or viral moment before completing your dare for a bonus point (or assign it as a symptom).

6. **Winning**  
   Play until the symptoms get too wild or everyone taps out. The last player standing without missing a symptom wins bragging rights (and maybe a dare-free round).

## Flu Game Variations

- **Wedding Party Games Style:**  
  For wedding vibes, use wedding-themed dares (“Give a toast in your worst best man voice!”) or couples drinking games twists (“Swap drinks with your partner for a round!”).

- **NSFW Dares:**  
  Feeling risky? Throw in some NSFW dares to spice things up—just make sure your group is cool with it!

- **Custom Builder:**  
  Want to create your own “symptoms” and dares? Use our custom drinking game builder to make your Flu Frenzy totally unique to your crew.

## Pro Tips for Your Viral Drinking Games Night

- Always drink responsibly and know your limits.
- Make sure everyone is comfortable with the dare challenges and symptoms—consent is key for unforgettable fun.
