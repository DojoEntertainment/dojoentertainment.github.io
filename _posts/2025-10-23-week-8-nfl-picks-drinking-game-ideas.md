So, your crew is gearing up for the big games this Sunday, snacks are stacked, but your party drinking games are looking a little… flat. Don’t sweat it. Let’s take your Week 8 NFL picks and turn them into a wild, meme-worthy drinking game that’ll keep everyone hyped from kickoff to the final whistle. Whether you're a football fanatic or just here for the vibes and the NSFW dares, this one’s for you.

## Turn NFL Sunday Into the Ultimate Drinking Game

No need for fancy gear—just your favorite drinks, a TV, and your best mates. This game is perfect for house parties, dorm hangouts, or even a wedding rager with a sports-loving crowd. If you’re feeling extra, use our [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) to level up with your own dares and challenges.

### What You’ll Need

- Your NFL Week 8 picks (everyone writes down their predictions for each matchup)
- Drinks of choice (beer, cocktails, mocktails—whatever fits your vibe)
- A list of dare challenges (get wild or keep it meme-y, your call)
- Pen and paper or a phone for tracking picks and points

## How To Play the Week 8 NFL Picks Drinking Game

1. **Lock In Your Picks**
   - Before the first game, everyone writes down who they think will win each matchup. No peeking or copying—trust your gut (or your favorite meme page’s predictions).

2. **Set Up The Dare Challenge Jar**
   - Write out a bunch of dare challenges—think viral drinking games, meme drinking games, and even some NSFW dares if the crowd is right. Toss them into a jar or bowl.

3. **Game Time Rules**
   - **Every Correct Pick:** Flex and make someone else drink.
   - **Every Wrong Pick:** You drink AND pull a dare from the jar.
   - **Wild Card Moments:**
     - If an underdog wins, everyone who didn’t pick them takes a shot.
     - If a meme-worthy play happens (think: a mascot wipeout, epic touchdown dance, or coach meltdown), everyone drinks.

4. **Bonus House Party Ideas**
   - Use themed drinks for each team (e.g., “Patriot Punch” or “Cowboy Cooler”).
   - Add bonus rounds for halftime—like a Fortnite drinking game-style challenge or election day drinking game trivia.

5. **Keep Track and Crown the Champ**
   - At the end of the night, the legend with the most correct NFL picks is the “Drinking Dojo MVP.” Loser? Get ready for one final, unforgettable dare.
