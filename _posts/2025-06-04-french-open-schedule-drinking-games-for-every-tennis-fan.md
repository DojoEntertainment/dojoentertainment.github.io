Ready to serve up some serious fun while catching the action from Roland-Garros? Whether you're hosting a house party, chilling with your squad, or just looking for new party drinking games to spice up your sports nights, the French Open schedule is the perfect excuse to take your drinking game up a notch. At Drinking Dojo, we know how to turn any event into an absolute banger — and a Grand Slam tournament is no exception.

### Why Drinking Games Make Tennis Even Better

Let's be real: tennis is thrilling, but add a few dare challenges and custom rules, and suddenly every ace, double fault, or epic rally turns into a reason to cheer (and sip). With the French Open schedule packed with non-stop matches, you’ve got endless opportunities for viral drinking games and meme-worthy moments.

### How To Play: French Open Drinking Game

#### Materials Needed
- Drinks of your choice (beer, cocktails, or non-alcoholic if you prefer)
- French Open schedule (official match times, player line-ups)
- Custom drinking game builder or printed rule cards
- Optional: Tennis-themed props, meme cards, or NSFW dares for after dark

#### The Rules

Here’s a classic Drinking Dojo twist to keep you on your toes:

**Take a sip when:**
- The commentator mentions Rafael Nadal’s record at Roland-Garros
- Someone shouts “Allez!”
- The camera zooms in on a celebrity in the crowd
- There’s a challenge review (Hawk-Eye time!)

**Take two sips when:**
- A player breaks serve
- There’s a tiebreak
- The umpire overrules a call

**Finish your drink if:**
- A player wins a set 6–0 (bagel!)
- Your favorite player loses in a major upset

**Dare challenge:**  
At the end of every match, the person who picked the losing player must draw a dare from your custom deck — think meme drinking games, NSFW dares, or wild party dares from Drinking Dojo.
