## 1. Shot Through the Heart: The Classic Couples Drinking Game

**Perfect for:** Couples, situationships, or BFFs who know too much about each other.

**What You’ll Need:**
- Drinks of your choice
- A deck of cards
- Your best poker face

**How to Play:**
- Shuffle the cards and lay them face-down in a heart shape (or as close as you can get after a few drinks).
- Take turns picking a card. Each suit corresponds to a dare or question:
  - **Hearts**: Answer a spicy question about your relationship (or friendship). If you refuse, take a drink.
  - **Diamonds**: Give a compliment or take two drinks.
  - **Clubs**: Draw a dare from a bowl (use our [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) to make it extra wild).
  - **Spades**: Both players drink.

The more honest or daring, the better. And yes, NSFW dares are totally encouraged—keep it fun and flirty!

## 2. Meme My Valentine: The Ultimate Meme Drinking Game

**Perfect for:** Meme lords, group chats, or anyone who can’t stop sending TikToks.

**What You’ll Need:**
- Phones or tablets
- Drinks
- A list of trending memes (or just use your feed)

**How to Play:**
- One person picks a meme and shows it to the group.
- Everyone rates it from 1 (meh) to 10 (legendary) by showing fingers.
- If two or more people pick the same number, they drink.
- If you show the lowest score, you have to recreate the meme—winner chooses the dare challenge!

You can up the chaos by making your friends turn personal pics into memes. The more viral, the better. It’s meme drinking games meets mayhem.
