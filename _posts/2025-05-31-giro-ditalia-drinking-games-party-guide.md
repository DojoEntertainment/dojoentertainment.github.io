## How to Play the Giro d'Italia Drinking Game

This drinking challenge is all about keeping up with the action, cheering on your favorite riders, and tackling dare challenges that push your crew into party legend status. Here’s the game plan:

### Basic Rules of the Giro d'Italia Party Drinking Games

**1. Choose Your Rider:**  
Each player picks a favorite cyclist (or team) to root for during the race. If you don’t know the riders, just pick a jersey color—it’s all part of the chaos.

**2. Drink on Race Events:**  
Every time one of these happens, everyone drinks:

- Your chosen rider is mentioned by the commentators (1 sip)
- There’s an epic crash or near miss (2 sips)
- Someone attacks on a climb (1 sip for everyone, 2 if it’s your rider)
- A wild fan in costume appears on screen (finish your drink if they cause mayhem)
- The commentators mention “pain” or “suffering” (1 sip)
- Rider takes a selfie or high-fives a fan (1 sip, 2 if it’s your rider)

**3. Dare Challenges:**  
When a commercial break hits or during the pre-race banter, it’s time for dare challenges! Use the Drinking Dojo dare cards or make your own. A few cycling-inspired dares:

- Try to do your best Italian accent while proposing a toast
- Balance a bottle on your head for 10 seconds, or drink
- Share the wildest party story that involves any kind of race (bonus: meme it!)
- The last person to stand and shout “Forza!” does a shot

**4. Meme Drinking Games:**  
Award bonus drinks for anyone who nails a cycling meme reference or drops a viral meme during the party. Add your own custom rules using our builder for max chaos.

## Pro Tips for the Ultimate Giro d'Italia Party Drinking Games Experience

- **Keep it safe:** Hydrate, snack, and look out for each other—especially if you’re tackling NSFW dares or going hard on drinking challenges.
- **Mix it up:** Throw in some couples drinking games or wedding party games if your group craves variety.
