## What You’ll Need

- Your favorite new show to watch (Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, you name it)
- Drinks of choice (beer, cocktails, or mocktails, if you’re just vibing)
- Shot glasses or cups
- Dare cards or your phone for custom dares
- A solid group of friends (2–10 works best)

## The Ultimate New Show Drinking Game Rules

We’re not just talking about sipping every time someone says “plot twist.” This is Drinking Dojo — where rules are made to be bent, and dares get wild. Here’s how to run the show:

### Setting Up

1. **Choose Your Show**  
   Pick a new show to watch that everyone’s excited about. The more dramatic, suspenseful, or meme-worthy, the better.

2. **Make Your Game Pack**  
   Use our [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) to create a personalized set of drinking challenges, dare challenges, and meme drinking games tailored to your show.

3. **Prep the Dares**  
   Want to go viral? Add in NSFW dares or classic meme dares for those epic moments.

### How to Play

**Basic Gameplay:**  
- Everyone watches the show together.  
- When a trigger happens (see below), the group follows the rule: drink, complete a dare, or both.

**Trigger Ideas:**  
- Someone says the show’s title  
- Dramatic music hits  
- Main character makes a wild decision  
- Awkward flirting or cringey moment  
- Viral meme reference or obvious product placement

**Drinking Challenges:**  
- First person to spot a plot hole assigns two drinks.  
- If you accidentally spoil the next episode, finish your drink.  
- If a fan-favorite character makes a surprise entrance, everyone drinks.

**Dare Challenges:**  
- Missed a trigger? Draw a dare! (Use our packs or make your own with the custom drinking game builder.)  
- Lost in the plot? Share your wildest theory in your best dramatic voice, or take a dare.

**Bonus House Party Ideas:**  
- Assign each player a character; drink whenever they’re on screen.  
- For wedding party games or couples drinking games, turn romantic scenes into couples challenges.

## Pro Tips for Epic Show Nights

- **Mix in meme drinking games** for laughs — like pausing for the best reaction faces and making everyone caption them.  
- Try themed packs, like “Fortnite drinking game” if your show is eSportsy, or go political with an “election day drinking game” for those wild docuseries.  
- Always keep it safe: know your limits and have water on hand.
