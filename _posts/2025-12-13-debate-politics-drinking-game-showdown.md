Let’s be real—political debates aren’t just for the news junkies and policy pundits anymore. They’ve become prime-time entertainment, meme factories, and, honestly, some of the best opportunities for wild party drinking games. Whether you’re watching with your housemates, hosting an election night bash, or just need an excuse to cheer (or groan) with your friends, debate politics is your ticket to an unforgettable night.

## Why Turn Debate Politics Into a Drinking Game?

Because politics is more fun with a drink in hand and a dare challenge on the line. From viral drinking games to meme drinking games, there’s nothing like watching politicians bicker while you’re racing your mates to finish a drink or attempt the wildest NSFW dare. Plus, it’s the perfect way to turn a potentially boring evening into a house party idea everyone will remember.

## What You’ll Need

- **A TV, laptop, or projector** streaming the debate.  
- **Drinks of your choice** (beer, wine, cocktails, or mocktails—no judgment here).  
- **Printed or digital rules** (see below or use Drinking Dojo’s [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) to make your own).  
- **Your crew**—the more, the merrier (and rowdier).  
- **Dare cards** (optional but highly recommended for extra spice).  

## How To Play: Debate Politics Drinking Game Rules

You can use our classic setup, or get creative by mixing in dare challenges and meme drinking games from Drinking Dojo.

### Basic Rules

Every time any of these happen during the debate, take a drink:

- A candidate interrupts another  
- Someone says “the American people,” “hardworking families,” or “taxes”  
- The moderator gets ignored  
- There’s an awkward silence  
- Someone dodges a question  
- A viral meme moment happens (think eye rolls, wild gestures, or “hot mic” fails)  

### Dare Challenges

For the bold (or just those who love chaos), add a dare challenge after every three drinks. Draw a dare card or make one up on the spot, like:

- Post a political meme to your Insta story  
- Speak in a candidate’s accent for the next minute  
- Text your ex a debate quote  
- Attempt a TikTok dance while explaining foreign policy  

### Bonus Rounds

Want to spice things up even more? Try these:

- **Election day drinking game:** Double your drinks when there’s a mention of swing states or polling numbers.  
- **Inauguration day drinking game:** Take a shot every time someone says “historic moment.”  
- **Couples drinking games:** If you’re playing as a duo, switch drinks with your partner every time a candidate says “unity.”
