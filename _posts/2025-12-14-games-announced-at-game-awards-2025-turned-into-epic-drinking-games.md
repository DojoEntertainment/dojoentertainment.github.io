## Game Awards 2025 Drinking Game Ideas

Here’s how to turn the most talked-about games into your next viral drinking challenge:

### 1. Co-Op Chaos

**Inspired by:** Any new multiplayer co-op game announced  
**How to Play:**  
- **Materials:** Drinks, notepads, pens  
- Split into teams. Each round, watch a trailer or gameplay reveal from Game Awards 2025.  
- Teams have 2 minutes to write down the wildest prediction for what happens next in the game.  
- Most accurate (or funniest) answer hands out drinks. Most off-the-wall answer does a dare challenge.  
- Bonus: Use a custom drinking game builder like [Drinking Dojo’s](https://drinkingdojo.com) to keep score or spice up the dares.

### 2. Meme Moment Mashup

**Inspired by:** The weirdest or most meme-worthy game moments  
**How to Play:**  
- **Materials:** Drinks, access to game trailers/clips  
- Every time someone spots a “cringe” moment, dramatic slow-mo, or ridiculous plot twist, everyone drinks.  
- If you call out a future meme and it actually happens in the trailer, choose someone to do an NSFW dare (if your crew is up for it).  
- Last person to spot a meme moment takes two drinks!

### 3. Fortnite Drinking Game 2025 Edition

**Inspired by:** New Fortnite updates or spin-offs announced  
**How to Play:**  
- **Materials:** Drinks, screen with trailer or live gameplay  
- Drink every time you see a new skin, dance emote, or crossover character.  
- If someone can guess a new weapon before it appears, hand out two drinks.  
- Miss a prediction? Complete a dare challenge.

### 4. Couples Drinking Games: Trailer Chemistry

**For pairs or dates in your group**  
- **Materials:** Drinks, game trailers  
- Each couple picks a newly announced game and “roleplays” as the main characters for the next 10 minutes.  
- If you break character, take a drink.  
- Most convincing couple gives out a dare challenge to another duo.

### 5. Wedding Party Games: Award Show Toasts

**Perfect for wedding after-parties or big celebrations**  
- **Materials:** Drinks, champagne, Game Awards acceptance speeches  
- Assign each person a nominee from the awards.  
- When your nominee wins, you make a toast and everyone drinks.  
- If your nominee loses, you do a dare picked by the group.
