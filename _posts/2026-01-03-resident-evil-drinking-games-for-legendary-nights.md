Ready to take your party drinking games to the next level? If you and your crew love a little chaos, a few jump scares, and a ton of laughs, it’s time to drop into the Resident Evil drinking game. Whether you’re vibing on the couch, hosting a house party, or looking for wild dare challenges, this viral drinking game is guaranteed to turn your night into an unforgettable experience.

### Why Play Resident Evil Drinking Games?

Mixing iconic gameplay with classic drinking challenges is a recipe for pure mayhem. From meme-worthy moments to NSFW dares, this game fits any crew—whether you’re OG fans or total newbies. Plus, with our custom drinking game builder, you can level up your rules, design wild dares, and keep every round fresh.

### What You’ll Need

- Any Resident Evil game (console or PC, solo or co-op)  
- Your favorite drinks (beer, cocktails, shots, whatever fits your vibe)  
- Friends (online or IRL)  
- Printed or digital dare challenges (optional: use [Drinking Dojo’s packs](https://drinkingdojo.com) for inspo)  
- A little courage (boss fights get wild)  

## How To Play The Resident Evil Drinking Game

Forget boring house party ideas—this one’s built for adrenaline junkies and meme-lovers alike. Here’s how to set it up:

### Basic Rules

1. **Choose Your Game Mode:**  
   - Story Mode: Play through the campaign and drink as you survive.  
   - Versus Mode: Compete for high scores or fastest boss kills.  

2. **Set Your Drinks:**  
   Decide on your drink of choice and pour up!  

3. **Assign Dare Challenges:**  
   Use our custom drinking game builder to create Resident Evil-inspired dares—or grab pre-made packs from Drinking Dojo.  

### Core Drinking Triggers

Take a sip/shot every time:  
- You find a green herb (or any healing item)  
- An enemy jumpscares you  
- You miss a shot (or completely whiff a puzzle)  
- Someone screams IRL (jump scares count)  
- A character says something truly cringey  

Finish your drink if:  
- You die and have to reload from a save  
- You run out of ammo at the worst possible moment  
- You accidentally heal at full health (rookie move)  

### Dare Challenges For Extra Spice

Want things a bit wilder? Add in some dare challenges between rounds:  
- **NSFW Dares:** Kiss the nearest survivor or reveal your most embarrassing fear (zombies don’t count)  
- **Meme Drinking Games:** Act out a classic Resident Evil meme before your next turn  
- **Fortnite Drinking Game Crossover:** Do a Fortnite dance every time you escape a boss unscathed  

### Couples & Group Variations

- **Couples Drinking Games:** Play co-op, but every time one partner messes up, both drink.  
- **Wedding Party Games:** Survivor teams—last team standing wins, losing team faces a dare challenge.  

## Pro Tips For Epic Nights

- Use the [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) to make your own Resident Evil dares or rules.  
- Rotate who controls the game each round—everyone gets a shot at survival.  
- Keep water and snacks handy (hydration is key when the zombies attack).  
- Mix in viral drinking games from Drinking Dojo for even more variety.
