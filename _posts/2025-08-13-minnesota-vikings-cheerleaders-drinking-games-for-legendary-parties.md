When you mix the hype of game day with the energy of the Minnesota Vikings cheerleaders, you know you’re in for a wild ride. But why just watch when you can play along? Whether you’re throwing a house party, pregaming before kickoff, or just want an excuse for new drinking games, let’s bring the stadium vibes to your living room with the ultimate party drinking games inspired by the Minnesota Vikings cheerleaders.

## Why Minnesota Vikings Cheerleaders Make Game Day Better

Let’s be real—no Vikings game is complete without the squad on the sidelines bringing the energy, stunts, and sparkle. Turning their cheer routines into drinking challenges is a sure-fire way to keep every touchdown and dance break extra memorable. If you’re looking for viral drinking games, meme drinking games, or just some spicy dare challenges, this one’s for you.

## What You Need

- A TV or screen to watch the Vikings game (or YouTube highlights of the cheerleaders)
- Alcoholic beverages (or mocktails for the sober crew)
- Shot glasses or cups
- Dare cards or slips of paper (optional)
- Friends ready to hype up the party

## Basic Rules For The Minnesota Vikings Cheerleaders Drinking Game

**Set-Up:**  
Gather your crew, pour your drinks, and tune in to the Vikings. Every time the cheerleaders hit the screen or pull a signature move, get ready for some action.

**How To Play:**

1. **Take a Sip When:**
   - The cheerleaders appear on camera.
   - They start a new dance routine.
   - The squad gets a close-up after a touchdown.

2. **Take a Shot If:**
   - The cheerleaders perform a stunt or lift.
   - Someone in your group can mimic a cheer move (bonus points for effort).
   - The camera catches them celebrating with fans.

3. **Dare Challenges:**
   - Missed a rule? Pick a dare from the pile—think NSFW dares or meme-inspired challenges.
   - Best dance impersonation of a cheerleader wins immunity for the next round.

4. **Viral Drinking Game Twist:**
   - Assign each person a cheerleader. When your cheerleader is on screen, everyone else drinks.
   - For every Vikings touchdown, the last person to stand and cheer does a double dare.
