## How to Play Man City vs Everton FC Timeline Drinking Game

Whether you’re a die-hard Premier League fan or just in it for the chaos, this game is built for unforgettable drinking challenges and dares. Here’s your game plan:

### What You’ll Need

- Your favorite drinks (beer, seltzers, cocktails — whatever gets you hyped)
- A screen to watch a Man City vs Everton F.C. match or replay (YouTube, live TV, streaming, whatever works)
- Dare cards or a list of NSFW dares (optional, but highly recommended for the bold)
- Drinking Dojo’s [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) for extra spice

### Basic Rules

1. **Pick Your Side:** Are you Team Man City or Team Everton? Split your group if you want rival vibes.
2. **Timeline Triggers:** As you watch, follow these classic party drinking game triggers:
   - **Goal scored:** All fans of the conceding team take two sips.
   - **Yellow card:** Everyone takes one sip.
   - **Red card:** Complete a dare challenge from your deck.
   - **Offside call:** First person to shout “VAR!” assigns a sip.
   - **Commentator says ‘pressure’ or ‘momentum’:** Last to raise their drink sips twice.
   - **Meme moment or wild celebration:** Group vote — best meme gets to hand out a dare.
3. **Halftime Dare:** At halftime, everyone draws (or creates) a meme drinking game challenge. Think viral drinking games, like “recreate a famous football goal in your living room” or “sing your team’s chant as loud as possible.”
4. **Full-Time Finish:** For every goal difference, the losing side does a finishing drink or faces an epic group dare.
