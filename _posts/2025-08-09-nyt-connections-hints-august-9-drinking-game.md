### What You’ll Need

- **A group of 3–10 friends** (the more, the messier!)
- **Drinks of choice** (cocktails, mocktails, or whatever suits your crew)
- **Paper and pens** or a whiteboard
- **Timer or phone stopwatch**
- **A list of connection-style word groups** (think categories and hidden links—make your own, find some online, or use the nyt connections hints august 9 as inspiration)
- **Dare cards or a custom dare list** (grab wild NSFW dares or meme drinking games dares from [Drinking Dojo](https://drinkingdojo.com))

### How To Play: Nyt Connections Drinking Game

1. **Form Teams**  
   Split everyone into teams of 2–4 people. If you’re only a few, play solo or in pairs.

2. **Setup Connections**  
   One person is the “Game Master” for the round. They pick a set of 16 words (inspired by nyt connections hints august 9, or make your own). Four groups of four words each secretly share a connection.

3. **The Challenge**  
   Teams have 2 minutes to group the 16 words into 4 correct categories. They can discuss, argue, or just throw wild guesses—it’s all part of the fun.

4. **Drinking Rules**  
   - **Correct Group:** The team that finds a correct group makes another team drink.
   - **Wrong Guess:** Mess up a group? Your own team drinks.
   - **Time’s Up:** Didn’t finish in time? Everyone drinks.
   - **Bonus Dare:** Every time a team gets a category wrong, they also draw a dare card or pick from the custom dare list. Get ready for spicy NSFW dares or viral meme challenges!

5. **Next Round**  
   Rotate the Game Master, refresh the word list (try themed rounds like “fortnite drinking game” or “election day drinking game” for extra laughs), and keep the party rolling.
