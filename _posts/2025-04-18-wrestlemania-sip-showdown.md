This game is perfect for both die-hard wrestling fans and newcomers alike, providing a thrilling way to engage with every suplex, smackdown, and surprise twist. 

### How to Play

The WrestleMania Sip Showdown is easy to set up and even easier to play. Gather your friends, grab your favorite beverages, and get ready to sip, cheer, and maybe even groan as the night unfolds.

#### Materials Needed

- A selection of your favorite drinks or non-alcoholic beverages
- A TV or device to stream WWE WrestleMania
- WrestleMania Sip Showdown rules (see below)
- Optional: WWE-themed decorations for that extra flair

#### Game Rules

1. **Entrance Extravaganza**: Take a sip every time a wrestler enters with a unique or over-the-top entrance. If there's pyrotechnics, that's an extra sip!

2. **Signature Moves**: Whenever a wrestler performs their signature move, everyone takes two sips. If you're not sure what the move is, don't worryâ€”just follow the crowd's reaction.

3. **Unexpected Alliances**: If a surprise tag team or alliance forms, clink glasses and take three sips.

4. **Near Falls**: Every time there's a two-count and the match almost ends, take a sip. These moments are sure to keep you on the edge of your seat!

5. **Announcer Catchphrases**: If an announcer uses a signature catchphrase or says something memorable, take a sip. Bonus sip if it's followed by a classic "Oh my God!" moment.

6. **Title Changes**: If a championship title changes hands, everyone finishes their drink in celebration (or consolation).

7. **Post-Match Drama**: Any post-match altercation or drama calls for another round of drinks. After all, the action never stops at WrestleMania!

### Tips for a Fun Night

- **Stay Hydrated**: Remember to have water on hand to stay hydrated and pace yourself throughout the event.
- **Snack Smart**: Keep plenty of snacks nearby. Wrestling can work up quite an appetite!
- **Designated Driver**: Safety first! Ensure everyone has a safe way to get home if they're drinking alcohol.
