## What You Need to Play French Open Drinking Games

- **TV or livestream** of the French Open (bonus points for a big screen)
- **Drinks** of choice (cocktails, beers, or mocktails for the sober champs)
- **French Open Scorecard** (optional, but makes it fun)
- Your favorite **dare challenges** (grab some from our [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com))
- Pen and paper for tracking dares or memes

## How the French Open Schedule Drinking Game Works

Here’s how you ace this drinking game, whether you’re at a dorm, a house party, or even a wedding after-party:

### Basic Rules for Party Drinking Games

1. **Pick Your Player:**  
   Everyone chooses a tennis player to root for in the match.

2. **Drink on These Moments:**  
   - Your player **aces a serve**: 1 drink.
   - **Double fault**: 2 drinks.
   - **Break point won**: 1 drink to everyone except the fan of the player who broke serve.
   - **Set goes to a tiebreak**: Everyone finishes their drink.
   - **Player challenges a call** and loses: 1 drink + a dare from the group.

3. **Dare Challenges:**  
   After each set, the group picks someone for a quick dare challenge—think meme drinking games, NSFW dares (if you dare), or viral drinking games inspired by what just happened on screen.

4. **Meme Moment:**  
   If the commentators say any classic tennis cliché (like “unforced error” or “grinding out the point”), everyone does a group toast and shares their best meme-worthy reaction.

## Bonus House Party Ideas for Drinking Challenges

- **Couples Drinking Games:** Pick doubles teams and compete against each other—losing pair takes a dare.
- **Wedding Party Games:** Use the French Open schedule as your backdrop for a raucous reception pregame.
- **Election Day or Fortnite Twist:** Swap in custom rules from our election day drinking game or fortnite drinking game if the match gets slow.
