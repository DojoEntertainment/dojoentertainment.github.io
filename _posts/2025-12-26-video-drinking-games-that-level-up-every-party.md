At Drinking Dojo, we’re all about bending the rules and ramping up the dares—so grab your favorite drinks, round up your friends (in person or online), and let’s get the party started.

## What Are Video Drinking Games?

Video drinking games are all about blending your favorite videos—whether YouTube, TikTok, or live streams—with classic drinking challenges and meme-worthy dares. They're perfect for long-distance hangouts, group watch parties, or even spicing up a Fortnite drinking game session.

## Top Video Drinking Games to Try Tonight

### 1. Sip If You See It

**Perfect for:** Meme drinking games, YouTube benders, TikTok scroll-athons

**How to Play:**
- Pick a playlist—anything from viral memes to wild animal fails.
- Before you hit play, everyone agrees on a list of triggers (e.g., anytime someone says "bro," a cat jumps, or there’s a TikTok dance).
- Whenever a trigger pops up, everyone takes a sip.
- For double fun, add a dare challenge every fifth trigger.

**Materials Needed:**
- A screen everyone can see (laptop, TV, tablet, or shared Zoom)
- Drinks of choice

### 2. Dare Roulette Live

**Perfect for:** House party ideas, long-distance friend groups, custom drinking game builder fans

**How to Play:**
- Everyone submits a dare challenge before the game starts (keep it spicy—think NSFW dares or meme-worthy antics).

- When a random moment happens (like an epic fail or someone drops a catchphrase), pause the video. The person closest to the pause has to spin the Dare Roulette and complete whatever comes up.

**Materials Needed:**
