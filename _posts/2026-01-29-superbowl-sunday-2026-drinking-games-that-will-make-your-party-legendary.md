Superbowl Sunday 2026 is almost here, which means it’s time to break out the snacks, rally your mates, and crank up the party vibes. But why settle for just watching the game when you can turn every touchdown, fumble, and commercial into a wild memory? At Drinking Dojo, we believe every gathering deserves unforgettable party drinking games, and Superbowl Sunday is the ultimate excuse.

Whether you’re throwing a massive house party, chilling with your roommates in the dorm, or tuning in from a cozy flat in London or Copenhagen, these viral drinking games and dare challenges will take your Superbowl experience to the next level.

## The Ultimate Superbowl Sunday 2026 Drinking Game

### What You’ll Need

- Your favorite drinks (beer, seltzers, cocktails, or non-alcoholic for the MVPs)
- Shot glasses or cups
- Printed or digital rules (scroll down!)
- Optional: Drinking Dojo’s [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) to add your own dares, memes, and team twists

### How to Play

1. **Split into Teams**  
   Rep your favorite Superbowl contender, or mix it up with random teams. Bonus points for dressing in your team’s colors!

2. **Set Up the Rules**  
   Hand out the list of drinking challenges and dares. Designate a “referee” to keep score and call out penalties.

3. **Game On**  
   Follow the rules below throughout the game, during commercials, and even during the halftime show. Remember: it’s about fun, not keeping count of every sip!

## Superbowl Sunday 2026 Drinking Challenge Rules

### During the Game

- **Touchdown**: Everyone on the *opposing* team drinks.
- **Field Goal Missed**: Last person to react takes a shot.
- **Turnover**: Everyone yells “fumble” — last to do so does a dare challenge.
- **Commercial Featuring a Dog**: Drink if you say “aww” out loud.
- **Coach’s Challenge Flag Thrown**: Group vote — if you think the ref will overturn the call, raise your glass. If you’re wrong, drink!

### Halftime Show

- **Celebrity Cameo**: First to spot takes two drinks (or assigns them).
- **Song Everyone Knows**: Sing along or do an NSFW dare.
- **Wardrobe Malfunction (let’s hope not)**: Everyone finishes their drink!

### For the Meme Lovers

- **Meme-Worthy Moment**: First to shout “MEME!” gets to create a quick dare for someone else.
- **Player Does a Dance**: Everyone copies the move — worst dancer drinks.

## Bonus: Superbowl Dare Challenges

Want to spice things up even more? Toss in these viral drinking game dares between quarters:

- **Touchdown Dance-Off**: Invent a new dance, loser chugs.
- **Superbowl Commercial Reenactment**: Act out the weirdest ad — best performance assigns three drinks.
