If student loan repayment changes have you and your mates feeling stressed, it’s time to flip the script—literally. Welcome to the Drinking Dojo’s ultimate student loan repayment changes drinking game, where the only thing on the line is your sobriety (and maybe your dignity). Whether you’re living that dorm life or crashing a house party, this drinking game is the perfect combo of memes, mayhem, and dare challenges to make the subject of student loans actually fun.

## Why Play a Student Loan Repayment Changes Drinking Game?

Student loan repayments are a drag, but turning them into party drinking games? Now that’s what we call adulting with style. Get your crew together, grab your favorite drinks, and let’s turn those repayments into legendary memories. Bonus points if you use our [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) to add your own wild NSFW dares or meme drinking games twists.

## What You Need for the Best Party Drinking Games Experience

- **At least 3 players** (the more the merrier)
- Your beverage of choice (responsibly, please!)
- A list of student loan repayment triggers (see below)
- Dare cards or slips of paper (optional but highly recommended)
- A device to pull up recent student loan news or viral drinking games memes

## How To Play This Viral Drinking Game

1. **Setup**  
   Gather everyone in a circle and make sure everyone has their drink ready. Each player writes down or prints out 2–3 news headlines or facts about student loan repayment changes from the past year.

2. **The Trigger List**  
   Here’s where you make things spicy. Assign a drink action to each of these triggers:
   - Someone says “forgiveness” – **Take one sip**
   - Interest rates are mentioned – **Take two sips**
   - “Income-driven” or “income-based” pops up – **Take a shot**
   - Someone confesses they haven’t checked their loan balance in months – **Everyone drinks**
   - A player references a viral meme about student loans – **Pass your drink to the left**

3. **Dare Challenges for Extra Chaos**  
   Every time a player gets caught not knowing a fact or rule about repayment changes, they must draw a dare card. Dares can be anything from “Text your ex about student loans” to “Do your best politician impression,” or even some of our signature NSFW dares—your call!

4. **Meme Drinking Games Twist**  
   If someone drops a meme or joke that gets at least 3 laughs, they can make up a new rule for the rest of the round. Get creative—think “Fortnite drinking game” style rules or wedding party games antics.

5. **Last Player Standing**  
   The game ends when someone finishes their drink and yells “Debt free!” That person gets to assign a final dare challenge to anyone in the group.
