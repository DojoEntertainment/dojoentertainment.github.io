Looking for a new spin on your party drinking games? Whether you’re a die-hard football fan or just love wild dare challenges, we’ve created a viral drinking game inspired by the Chelsea FC vs Brighton & Hove Albion FC timeline. This game is perfect for pregames, house parties, or even your next game night with the crew.

## The Ultimate Timeline Drinking Game

Imagine every twist and turn of a Chelsea vs Brighton match, but with drinks, dares, and enough meme-worthy moments to keep everyone laughing. Here’s how to bring the action from the pitch to your living room.

### What You’ll Need

- **A replay or live stream** of any Chelsea FC vs Brighton & Hove Albion FC match (YouTube highlights work too)  
- **Drinks of your choice** (beer, seltzers, cocktails—whatever fuels your fun)  
- **A group of football-loving mates** (or anyone down for a laugh)  
- **Printed or digital copy** of the rules (scroll down for those)  
- **Optional:** Dare cards or use our [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) to spice things up  

### How to Play

**1. Set Up Your Squad:**  
Split into two teams—Chelsea and Brighton. If you have more than six, create neutral “Referees” who hand out dare challenges.

**2. Kickoff Cheers:**  
Everyone raises a glass at kickoff and takes a sip to get the party started.

**3. Game On—Drink When…**

- **A goal is scored:** The opposing team drinks twice. If your team scores, everyone else drinks.  
- **Yellow card:** All players do a quick dare challenge—think NSFW dares or meme-inspired forfeits.  
- **Red card:** Everyone finishes their drink.  
- **Offside call:** Last person to shout “VAR!” takes a sip.  
- **Ridiculous commentator moment:** First to mimic the commentator hands out a drink.  
- **Epic save:** Goalkeeper’s fans (choose at the start) nominate someone for a dare.  

**4. Halftime Challenge:**  
During halftime, each team creates a viral meme about the first half using their phones. The best meme (voted by the Referees) makes the losing team do a group dare.

**5. Timeline Twist:**  
At random points, pause the video and ask trivia about Chelsea or Brighton’s history. Wrong answer? Take a drink or complete a dare.

**6. Final Whistle:**  
Winning team makes the losers do a drinking challenge chosen by everyone (think wedding party games or couples drinking games for extra fun).
