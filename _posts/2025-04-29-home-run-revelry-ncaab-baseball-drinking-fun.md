This baseball-inspired drinking game is simple to set up, easy to play, and guarantees laughs and cheers with every pitch. So grab your caps and koozies, and let's play ball!

#### What You'll Need

- **A Group of Friends**: Ideally, four or more people to keep the game lively.
- **Baseball Game Broadcast**: Tune in to any NCAAB baseball game.
- **Beverages**: Your choice of drink—beer, cider, or any other preferred brew.
- **Scorecards**: Optional, but useful for tracking everyone's progress.

#### Game Setup

1. **Divide into Teams**: Just like in baseball, divide your group into two teams. You can be as creative as you like with team names—perhaps named after your favorite NCAAB teams.

2. **Select a Designated Drinker**: Each team selects one person who will drink when certain events occur during the game.

3. **Prepare the Play Space**: Arrange your seating around the TV to ensure everyone has a good view of the game.

#### Rules and How to Play

1. **Strikeout Sip**: Every time a batter from either team strikes out, the opposing team takes a sip of their drink.

2. **Home Run Chug**: When a batter hits a home run, everyone must chug their drink until the runner touches home plate.

3. **Double Play Double Shot**: If a double play occurs, everyone takes two shots or two gulps of their drink.

4. **Walk It Out**: If a player is walked, the designated drinker must drink for the duration the player walks to first base.

5. **Change the Pitcher**: When a team changes their pitcher, everyone finishes their current drink and grabs a fresh one.

6. **Instant Replay**: If there's a replay review, players must drink continuously until the play is resolved.

#### Bonus Round: Seventh Inning Stretch

During the traditional seventh-inning stretch, everyone stands, refills their drinks, and toasts to the team with the most runs. The team with fewer runs has to sing a baseball-themed song chosen by the opposing team.

#### Safety First

Remember, it's all about having fun. Make sure everyone is of legal drinking age and drink responsibly. Keep water and snacks handy to stay hydrated and happy throughout the game.
