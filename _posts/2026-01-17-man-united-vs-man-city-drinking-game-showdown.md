Looking for the ultimate party drinking game that’s just as fierce as the Manchester derby? Whether you’re a die-hard Red Devil or a proud Citizen, it’s time to spice up match day with a viral drinking game that’ll have the whole squad on their feet. Grab your mates, stock the fridge, and get ready for a night of dares, memes, and pure football mayhem.

## What You’ll Need

- A TV tuned into the Man United vs Man City match (live or replay, your call)  
- Your favorite drinks (beer, cider, cocktails—just don’t go full Roy Keane)  
- A group of 3 or more party legends  
- Printed or digital rules (bookmark this page!)  
- Optional: Custom drinking game cards or memes from [Drinking Dojo’s custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com)  

## How to Play

This party drinking game is all about reacting to what happens on the pitch—plus a few wild NSFW dares and meme-worthy challenges to keep things interesting. Here’s how to get started:

### Basic Rules

1. **Kickoff Cheers**  
   Everyone takes a drink as the whistle blows to start the match.

2. **Goal Galore**  
   - If Man United scores, City fans drink.  
   - If Man City scores, United fans drink.  
   - Neutral fans? Everyone drinks!

3. **Yellow Card Challenge**  
   When a yellow card is handed out, the person who last got roasted in the group chat does a dare challenge (use the Drinking Dojo dare cards for max chaos).

4. **Red Card Rumble**  
   If there’s a red card, everyone in the room finishes their drink and pulls a meme drinking game card from the deck—think viral TikTok dance or best football chant impression.

5. **VAR Mayhem**  
   Whenever VAR is called, the group pauses and predicts the outcome. Those who guess wrong take a double drink.

6. **Offside Outrage**  
   The first person to spot an offside gets to assign two drinks to anyone.

7. **Halftime Dare**  
   At halftime, everyone draws a dare (NSFW dares optional, especially for those wild house party ideas).

### Bonus Round: Meme Drinking Game

- Share your favorite meme from the match in a group chat or on Insta.  
- The best meme wins; the loser does a drinking challenge or a couples drinking game dare (perfect if you’ve brought your partner along).
