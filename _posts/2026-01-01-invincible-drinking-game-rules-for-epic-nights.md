Ready to unleash your inner hero (or just survive the wildest party drinking games)? Meet Invincible—the drinking game that’s all about outlasting your friends, crushing dare challenges, and becoming the legend of your next house party. Whether you’re in a buzzing dorm, vibing at a wedding afterparty, or chilling with your mates in Sydney or Copenhagen, Invincible is your ticket to unforgettable memories, meme-level moments, and a LOT of laughs.

## What is the Invincible Drinking Game?

Invincible isn’t just another drinking game—it’s a party drinking game where the only thing more important than your drink is your willpower. The goal? Be the last player standing (or, let’s be real, the last player still making sense). It’s simple, wild, and ridiculously fun, with dares, NSFW twists, and meme drinking games energy built right in.

## What You’ll Need

- 3 or more players (the more, the messier)
- Your favorite drinks (beer, cocktails, seltzers—whatever you fancy)
- A deck of Dare Cards (or just use your phone and Drinking Dojo’s [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) for endless dares and challenges)
- A notepad or phone for scorekeeping  
- Optional: Meme cards, props, or costumes for extra chaos

## How to Play Invincible

### Setup

1. **Circle Up:** Everyone sits in a circle with their drink.
2. **Deal the Dares:** Shuffle the Dare Cards (or generate them with Drinking Dojo’s custom drinking game builder).
3. **Pick Your Hero:** Each player chooses a “hero name” for the game. (Get creative—think meme drinking games style!)
4. **Set Your Limit:** Decide on the number of “lives” each player has. Standard is 3 lives per person.

### Game Play

1. **Draw a Card:** The first player draws a Dare Card and reads it aloud.
2. **Face the Challenge:** They must complete the dare or challenge. Dares can be anything from “do your best Fortnite dance while chugging” (hello, fortnite drinking game fans) to “confess your most embarrassing DM.”
3. **Win or Lose:** If they succeed, they keep their lives. If they fail, they lose one life and take a drink.
4. **Next Up:** Play passes to the left. Keep cycling through dare challenges, meme drinking games, and wild party drinking games.
5. **Out but Not Gone:** When a player loses all their lives, they have to complete a final “Invincible Challenge” (make it epic—think NSFW dares, wedding party games, or something themed for the night). Then, they become the Judge for the rest of the game, dishing out dares and keeping things spicy.
6. **Last One Standing:** The last player with lives left is crowned Invincible—and gets bragging rights, a victory toast, or a custom meme from the group.

### Pro Tips for Epic Nights

- Mix in viral drinking games rules or pop culture references for extra laughs.
- Use the custom drinking game builder to personalize dares for your crew or the occasion (from election day drinking game twists to couples drinking games for date night).
- Up the ante at house parties with team play—form alliances or sabotage rivals.
- For wedding party games, add couples-only dares or “roast the groom” challenges.

## Why Invincible Is Your New Go-To Drinking Game

- **Unforgettable:** Every round is different, every dare is legendary.
- **Flexible:** Perfect for any occasion—house parties, weddings, or just chilling with friends.
- **Social:** Get everyone talking, laughing, and maybe oversharing a little.
- **Customizable:** Build your own dares and challenges to fit your squad’s vibe.
