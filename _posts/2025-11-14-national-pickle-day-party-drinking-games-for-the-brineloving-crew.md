Pickles aren’t just for burgers, sandwiches, or midnight cravings—they’re the unsung heroes of snack tables and, believe it or not, the next star of your party drinking games lineup. National Pickle Day is here to spice up your house party ideas with a salty, sour twist, and Drinking Dojo is ready to bring the mayhem. If you’re on the hunt for viral drinking games or meme drinking games that get everyone involved, it’s time to prep your brine and rally the crew.

## Why National Pickle Day Is Prime Time For Drinking Games

First off, pickles are hilarious. They crunch, they pucker, and they’re the ultimate prop for unforgettable dare challenges. Whether you’re hosting a wedding rager, pulling together a last-minute pregame, or just vibing with your mates in a dorm room, pickle-themed party drinking games are a straight-up conversation starter.

## Essential Materials For Pickle Drinking Games

Here’s what you’ll need to get the party started:
- A few jars of pickles (get a variety—dills, gherkins, spicy, whatever makes you snicker)
- Your favorite drinks (beer, cider, cocktails, or even pickle vodka if you’re feeling fancy)
- Shot glasses
- Napkins (trust us)
- A sense of adventure

Optional: Meme-worthy pickle hats, green face paint, or a pickle costume for the daredevils.

## The Viral Drinking Game: Pickle Roulette

This one is simple, wild, and perfect for National Pickle Day. It’s the drinking game you never knew you needed.

### How To Play Pickle Roulette:
1. **Set the Table:** Place a mix of pickles on a tray. Some should be classic, others super sour, spicy, or weird flavors.
2. **Spin the Bottle or Roll a Die:** The chooser spins, points, or rolls to pick a pickle at random.
3. **Pickle Dare:** Each pickle comes with a dare challenge. Write dares on slips of paper and place them under each pickle. Example NSFW dares could include texting your crush a pickle pun or doing your best pickle impression.
4. **Eat and Drink:** The player eats the pickle, completes the dare, then takes a shot or drink. If they chicken out, they finish their drink instead.

#### Pro Tip: Use our [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) to generate the wildest dares and keep things fresh every round.

## Couples Drinking Games: Pickle Pucker-Up

Who says pickles can’t be romantic? For couples or friends feeling brave, try this:

- Each person picks a pickle.
- Eat it without making a face—first to pucker takes a drink.
- If you both survive, share a drink and swap your funniest pickle story.

## More Party Drinking Games For Pickle Lovers

- **Pickle Shot Relay:** Teams race to eat a pickle and down a shot, relay-style. Fastest team wins bragging rights.
- **Pickle Charades:** Act out “pickle” scenes (think: being a pickle in a jar, getting fished out, etc.). Loser drinks.

## House Party Ideas For Going Full Pickle

- Serve pickleback shots (whiskey chased with pickle juice) for bonus points.
- Add pickle-flavored snacks to your grazing table.
- Award a prize for the best pickle-themed outfit—winner gets to assign a dare.
