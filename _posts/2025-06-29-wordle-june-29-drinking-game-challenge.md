### What You Need

- **A phone or laptop** (to play Wordle June 29)  
- **Drinks of your choice** (beer, cocktails, or your signature house punch)  
- **Your squad** (2+ players)  
- **A notepad or phone notes** (for bonus rounds or dares)  

### How to Play Wordle June 29 as a Drinking Game

No need for complicated setups—just bring your best guesses and a sense of adventure. Here’s how you turn Wordle into one of the most unforgettable party drinking games:

#### 1. Set Up the Game
- Open Wordle June 29 on your device.  
- Decide on the order of play. (Random draw, youngest goes first, or let the person with the wildest NSFW dares kick things off.)  

#### 2. The Main Rules

- **One Guess, One Sip:** Each player types in a guess. If your guess doesn’t reveal any new green letters, take a sip.  
- **Full Gray Row:** If you guess a word and all the letters are gray, finish your drink or take a dare challenge.  
- **First Green Letter:** The first person to score a green letter hands out two sips to anyone.  
- **Duplicate Guess Penalty:** If you repeat a word that’s already been guessed, take a shot or do a dare from the group.  

#### 3. The Dare Round

Didn’t solve Wordle June 29 in six tries? It’s time for a dare challenge:
- The group agrees on a wild dare (think: meme drinking games, NSFW dares, or something from our [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com)).  
- The loser must complete the dare, filmed or not—it’s up to your house party rules.  

#### 4. Bonus Party Twists

Spice it up for themed nights or special occasions:
- **Wedding party games:** Bridal or groom guesses wrong? They have to share a hilarious wedding story before sipping.  
- **Couples drinking games:** Partners team up—if one fails, both drink.  
- **Election day or inauguration day drinking game:** Replace dares with political memes or create custom party rules.
