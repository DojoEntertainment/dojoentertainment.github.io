This game is inspired by the infamous Menendez brothers case and is sure to add a thrilling twist to your next gathering. Grab your friends and get ready for a night of suspense and laughter.

## Materials Needed

- A group of friends (at least 4 players)
- A deck of cards
- Alcoholic beverages of your choice
- A timer
- A cozy and safe environment

## How to Play

### Setting Up

1. **Gather Your Group:** Make sure everyone has a drink in hand.
2. **Deck of Cards:** Shuffle the deck and place it in the center of the table.
3. **Designate Roles:** Choose one player to be the "Judge". The Judge will ask questions and ensure the rules are followed.

### Game Rules

1. **Draw a Card:** Players take turns drawing a card from the deck. Each card represents a different action:
    - **Ace:** Tell a Suspicious Story. The player must tell a story that sounds suspicious or mysterious. If the group finds it convincing, everyone else drinks.
    - **King:** Confession Time. The player must confess something they've done in the past. If anyone else has done the same thing, they drink.
    - **Queen:** Question Round. The Judge asks the player a yes or no question. If they answer yes, they drink. If they answer no, the Judge drinks.
    - **Jack:** Lie Detector. The player tells two truths and one lie. The group must guess which one is the lie. If the group guesses correctly, the player drinks. If they guess wrong, the group drinks.
    - **Number Cards (2-10):** These are safe cards, and the player does not have to do anything.

2. **Timer Challenge:** The Judge sets a timer for 5 minutes. During this time, the player who drew the card must complete their action. If they fail to do so, they must take an additional drink.

3. **Group Decision:** At any point, if the group suspects a player of not being truthful or failing to complete their action convincingly, they can call for a vote. If the majority agrees, the player must take an additional drink.

### Winning the Game

The game continues until the deck is exhausted or the players decide to end it. The player who can tell the most convincing stories and keep their cool under pressure wins the game. Remember, the goal is to have fun and enjoy the company of your friends.

## Safety First

Always remember to drink responsibly and know your limits. Ensure that everyone has a safe way to get home after the game. The Menendez Brothers Drinking Game is designed for entertainment and should never be taken too seriously.
