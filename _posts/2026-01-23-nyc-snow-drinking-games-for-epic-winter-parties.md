When NYC snow starts falling, city nights get a whole new vibe. Suddenly, the streets are quieter, the rooftops are covered in white, and your living room begs for a wild night in. If you’re looking for the ultimate way to celebrate a snow day with friends, Drinking Dojo has your back with party drinking games, dare challenges, and meme drinking games perfect for frosty nights.

Here’s how to turn the next snowstorm into a legendary pregame, house party, or couples’ night you’ll be talking about until the slush melts.

## NYC Snow Drinking Game Rules

Nothing says winter in the city like ordering pizza, piling on hoodies, and breaking out the best drinking games. Our NYC Snow Drinking Game is easy to play, totally customizable, and designed for unforgettable mayhem—no matter how many inches pile up outside.

**What You’ll Need:**

- Your favorite drinks (beer, seltzers, cocktails—your call)
- A deck of cards or the [Drinking Dojo custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com)
- A cozy living room, apartment rooftop, or snow-covered stoop
- Optional: Meme cards, dare cards, or your own wild ideas

### How To Play NYC Snow Drinking Games

1. **Set Up Your Game Pack:**  
   Use Drinking Dojo’s custom drinking game builder to create a mix of classic challenges, dares, and meme drinking games. Or, grab one of our viral drinking games packs ready-made for snow day shenanigans.

2. **Shuffle & Deal:**  
   Shuffle your deck. Take turns drawing a card. Each card comes with a challenge, meme, or dare tied to NYC snow—think “Take a shot if you’ve ever slipped on black ice” or “Chug if you’ve had a subway delay today.”

3. **Dare Challenges:**  
   Sprinkle in some wild dares—like “Run outside and make a snow angel in your underwear” or “Send a selfie to your ex with snow on your head.” For an extra twist, add NSFW dares for after-hours madness.

4. **Snowy House Rules:**  
   - If someone mentions the MTA, they drink.
   - First person to complain about the cold must finish their drink.
   - If a plow goes by, everyone cheers and takes a group sip.

5. **Keep It Going:**  
   Keep playing until the snow stops, the drinks run out, or someone falls asleep in a pile of jackets.
