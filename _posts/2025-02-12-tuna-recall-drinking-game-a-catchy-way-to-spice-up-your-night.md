---


Looking for a fresh and fun drinking game to liven up your party? Dive into the quirky world of Tuna Recall, a game that blends creativity, laughter, and a bit of nostalgia. Inspired by the infamous tuna recalls that have popped up in recent years, this game is all about quick thinking and a good sense of humor. Grab your favorite drinks and get ready to reel in some unforgettable moments with friends.

## What You Need

To play the Tuna Recall drinking game, you will need the following materials

- A group of friends (at least 4 players is ideal)
- A deck of cards
- Drinks of your choice
- A timer or stopwatch
- A sense of humor

## Setting Up the Game

1. **Prepare the Cards**: Shuffle the deck and place it face down in the center of the table.
2. **Choose a Starting Player**: Select someone to start the game. This can be done by having players draw a card each and the highest card goes first.
3. **Set the Timer**: Ensure your timer is ready to go. Each round will be timed, adding an exciting twist to the game.

## How to Play

### Objective

The goal of Tuna Recall is to avoid being the player with the most cards at the end of the game. The player with the most cards must finish their drink.

### Game Play

1. **Draw a Card**: Starting with the first player, each player draws a card from the deck and places it face up for everyone to see.
   
2. **Tuna Recall Rule**: The player who draws the card must quickly name a brand or type of tuna within 10 seconds. For example Bumble Bee, Starkist, or even types like albacore.

3. **Failure to Recall**: If the player fails to name a tuna brand or type within the time limit, they must take a drink.

4. **Creative Twist**: To keep things interesting, once a player successfully names a tuna, the next player must come up with a different brand or type. Repeating a previous answer results in an extra drink penalty.

5. **Special Cards**: 
   - **Ace**: The player who draws an Ace can skip their turn and choose another player to draw a card in their place.
   - **King**: The player who draws a King must name two tuna brands or types. If successful, they can choose another player to take a drink.
   - **Queen**: The player who draws a Queen can create a new category of seafood (e.g., types of shrimp) for the next round, adding an extra layer of challenge.
   
6. **Ending the Game**: Continue playing until the deck is exhausted or players decide to stop. The player with the most cards at the end must finish their drink.

### Tips for a Fun Game Night

- Encourage creativity and humor. Making up fictitious tuna brands can be a hilarious twist.
- Consider setting a maximum drink limit to ensure everyone stays safe and has fun.
- If tuna brands become too challenging, switch to a different food recall theme like cereal or candy.
