Looking for your next viral drinking game that’s easy to play, totally wild, and gets the whole squad hyped? The Ind vs Ned drinking game is the latest party drinking game you need to add to your rotation. Whether you’re pregaming for the big match, chilling in a dorm room, or leveling up your house party ideas, this game brings that unforgettable Drinking Dojo energy.  

## What Is the Ind vs Ned Drinking Game?

Ind vs Ned is all about friendly rivalry, quick thinking, and daring challenges. Inspired by the epic energy of international showdowns, this drinking game splits your party into two wild teams: Team Ind and Team Ned. Every round is packed with meme-worthy moments, dare challenges, and a whole lot of laughs.

It’s perfect for:
- House parties looking for new drinking challenges
- Wedding party games that don’t take themselves too seriously
- Game nights that need a little extra heat
- Fans of custom drinking game builder tools and viral drinking games

## What You’ll Need

- **A group of 4+ players** (the more, the wilder!)
- Plenty of your favorite drinks (beer, cocktails, shots—your dojo, your rules)
- Two hats, buckets, or bowls labeled TEAM IND and TEAM NED
- Pre-written challenge cards (or use Drinking Dojo’s [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) to print your own)
- A coin for coin flips

## How to Set Up

1. **Divide into Teams:**  
   Split everyone into Team Ind and Team Ned. Even numbers are best, but don’t sweat it if it’s uneven—just rotate who sits out.
2. **Prepare the Challenge Cards:**  
   Write dares, meme drinking games, and classic drinking challenges on slips of paper. Need inspo? Think NSFW dares, “finish your drink,” or “do your best Fortnite dance”—sky’s the limit!
3. **Stock the Drinks:**  
   Make sure everyone is ready with a full glass. Hydration is key, but so is party spirit.

## Game Rules

1. **Start the Showdown:**  
   Flip a coin. Winning team draws the first challenge card from their team’s hat.
2. **Face the Challenge:**  
   The chosen player can either complete the dare challenge or pass. If they pass, they drink.
3. **Steal or Sip:**  
   If a player passes, the opposing team can “steal” and try the challenge for double points (if points are being tracked) or make the other team drink double.
4. **Keep It Rolling:**  
   Alternate between teams, drawing cards and keeping the energy sky-high.  
5. **Bonus Rounds:**  
   - *Meme Madness*: Every third round, draw a meme drinking game card—think “Imitate a viral meme or finish your drink.”
   - *Wildcard*: If someone draws a “Wildcard” card, everyone drinks!

## Winning the Night

Play for a set time limit or until the cards run out. The team with the most completed challenges or points wins ultimate bragging rights (and maybe a dare of their choosing for the losing team).

## Hot Tips for Epic Nights

- Mix in themed dares for special occasions—election day drinking game, inauguration day drinking game, or even a Fortnite drinking game twist!
- Perfect for couples drinking games, too—just play in pairs and add some spicy dares.
- Crank up the fun with meme drinking games inspired by viral trends in the US, UK, Canada, Australia, and Denmark.
