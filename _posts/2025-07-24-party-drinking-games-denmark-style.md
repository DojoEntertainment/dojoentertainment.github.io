If you’re looking to raise the bar (pun intended) for your next house party, Denmark is where it’s at for wild, unforgettable drinking games. Danish party culture is all about good company, bold dares, and going all-in — and we’re here to show you how to add that legendary Scandi twist to your next pregame or wedding bash.

Ready for some viral drinking games from Denmark? Time to round up your mates, grab your drinks, and get weird. Let’s break down some of the best Denmark-inspired party drinking games, plus a custom drinking game builder idea to keep things spicy.

## Danish Dice: The Ultimate Drinking Challenge

**What you need:**
- 2 dice  
- Drinks for everyone  
- A table

**How to play:**
1. Everyone sits in a circle with their drink.
2. The first player rolls both dice.
3. If they get a 7, 11, or doubles, they pick someone to drink. If not, they pass the dice.
4. Here’s the twist: If you roll snake eyes (double ones), everyone at the table drinks and the roller makes up a new rule for the rest of the game.
5. The rule sticks until someone else rolls snake eyes and creates a new one.
6. Keep going until your dares get out of hand, your rules get ridiculous, or your drinks run dry.

**Why it rocks:** Rules are made to be bent, and with every round, the chaos (and fun) grows. Perfect for house parties and big groups.

## Meme Drinking Games: Danish Edition

Denmark loves a good meme as much as you do. Put a twist on viral drinking games by combining meme culture with NSFW dares. Here’s a quick setup:

- Everyone writes down their favorite meme catchphrase on a piece of paper (think “It’s Wednesday, my dudes” or “Pepega”).
- Shuffle and draw at random.
- Whenever someone says their meme phrase during the party, they take a drink and issue a dare challenge to someone else.
- The dare can be anything — dance on a chair, text your ex, or try your best Viking roar.

*Bonus points for adding local flavor: Throw in some Danish slang for extra laughs.*
