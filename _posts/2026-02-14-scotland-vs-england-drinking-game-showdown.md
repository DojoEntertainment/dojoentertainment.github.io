Looking for a drinking game that matches the energy of a classic Scotland vs England showdown? Whether you’re celebrating a big match, hyping up your house party, or just want a new viral drinking game for your next get-together, this one’s for you. Grab your mates, pick your side, and get ready for a party drinking game packed with dares, memes, and a touch of national pride.

### What You Need

- **At least 4 players** (split into Team Scotland and Team England)  
- Your favorite drinks (beer, cider, cocktails—whatever suits your vibe)  
- Shot glasses  
- Score pad or phone for tracking points  
- A deck of cards (optional but makes it extra wild)  
- A list of dares or use our [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) for meme-worthy challenges  

### How to Play the Scotland vs England Drinking Game

#### 1. **Pick Your Sides**  
Split your crew into two teams—Scotland and England. If you’ve got more than 8 people, make multiple squads and rotate in.

#### 2. **Kickoff Round**  
Flip a coin or play a quick round of rock-paper-scissors to decide which team goes first.

#### 3. **Challenge Time**  
Teams take turns drawing cards (or pick numbers if you’re keeping it simple). Each card/number is linked to a dare or challenge. These can be classic drinking challenges, meme drinking games, or NSFW dares for the brave.  

**Examples:**  
- **Red Card (Scotland):** Make your best Scottish accent. If your team laughs, you drink.  
- **Black Card (England):** Recite a famous English meme. Mess it up? Take a shot.  

#### 4. **Viral Drinking Game Rounds**  
Mix in themed challenges:  
- **Inauguration Day Drinking Game:** Everyone toasts to their team’s “next big win.” Last to drink does a dare.  
- **Fortnite Drinking Game Twist:** Winner of a round does a victory dance. Loser drinks for as long as it lasts.  
- **Couples Drinking Games:** Pair up across teams for a round of truth or dare challenges. Lose? Both drink.  

#### 5. **Score Points**  
Each successful challenge or dare earns your team a point. First team to 10 wins—or keep going until drinks run out or the party moves on!

#### 6. **Penalty Shots**  
Mess up a challenge? Take a penalty shot. Refuse a dare? Double penalty.

#### 7. **Victory Toast**  
Winning team gets bragging rights and leads the final group toast.
