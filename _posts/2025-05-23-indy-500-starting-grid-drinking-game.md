Ready to turn your next house party or pregame into a high-octane showdown? Buckle up, because the Indy 500 Starting Grid drinking game is here to bring big energy, wild dares, and plenty of party drinking games vibes. Whether you’re a racing fan or just love a reason to compete with friends, this game is the fast track to unforgettable memories (and maybe a couple of viral drinking games moments).

### What You Need

- **A group of 4–20 players** (the more, the merrier)
- **A large open space** (perfect for living rooms, backyards, or big dorms)
- **Drinks of your choice** (beer, seltzers, cocktails—whatever fuels your race)
- **Numbered cards or paper** (to assign starting grid positions)
- **A ‘track’ area** (use tape, furniture, or just imaginary lanes)
- **A dare challenge deck** (grab a pack from [Drinking Dojo](https://drinkingdojo.com) or make your own with NSFW dares, meme drinking games prompts, and custom rules)

### How To Play

#### Set Up Your Starting Grid

1. **Assign Starting Positions:**  
   Shuffle the numbered cards and hand them out. Each player’s number is their starting spot on the grid.

2. **Line Up:**  
   Arrange everyone in order—just like the real Indy 500. The player in pole position starts up front, and the rest line up behind.

#### The Race Is On

3. **The Countdown:**  
   Someone shouts “Start your engines!” Everyone cheers and takes their first sip.

4. **Take the First Lap:**  
   The game begins with the player in the front (Position 1). They draw a dare card or challenge from the deck and must complete it.  
   - **Success?** They stay in front.
   - **Fail?** They swap places with the person behind them and take a penalty sip.

5. **Passing and Pit Stops:**  
   After each challenge, the next player gets their turn. If they nail their dare challenge, they can challenge the person in front of them for a “pass”—face off in a meme drinking game, quick trivia, or a custom drinking challenge. Winner moves up, loser drinks.

6. **Crashes and Cautions:**  
   If anyone spills a drink or messes up a dare epically, everyone shouts “Caution!” All racers take a celebratory sip and reset in their positions.

7. **Finish Line Showdown:**  
   After a set number of laps (decide as a group), whoever’s in first place wins ultimate bragging rights—and gets to make up a wild group dare or choose a drinking challenge for everyone else.

### Rule Variations and Epic Twists

- **Couples Drinking Games Mode:** Pair up and compete as teams. Both must complete dares together or swap positions.
- **Wedding Party Games Version:** Use fun, wedding-themed dares for the newlyweds and guests.
- **Custom Drinking Game Builder:** Want to level up? Create your grid, dares, and challenges using [Drinking Dojo’s custom tool](https://drinkingdojo.com).

### Pro Tips To Keep It Legendary

- Mix in viral drinking games dares for added chaos.
- Use house party ideas from your crew to make each lap unpredictable.
- Don’t forget to hydrate—racing is thirsty work!
