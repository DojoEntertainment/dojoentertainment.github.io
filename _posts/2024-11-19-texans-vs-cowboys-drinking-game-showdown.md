## What You Need

To host your very own Texans vs Cowboys drinking game night you'll need the following

- A group of friends. Ideally at least four players
- A variety of drinks. Stock up on beer, whiskey, or any beverage of your choice
- A deck of cards
- A cowboy hat or a Texas-themed hat
- A timer or stopwatch

## How to Play

### Setting Up

1. **Divide into Teams**: Split the group into two teams. One team represents the Texans and the other represents the Cowboys. Each team should have an equal number of players for a fair showdown

2. **Choose a Team Leader**: Each team selects a leader who will wear the cowboy or Texas-themed hat. The leader is responsible for guiding their team and keeping the game lively

### Game Rules

1. **Card Draw**: Shuffle the deck of cards and place it in the center of the table. Teams take turns drawing a card from the deck. Each card has a specific action associated with it

2. **Card Actions**:

   - **Ace**: The team that draws an Ace gets a free pass. Enjoy a sip of your drink while the other team takes a shot
   - **King**: Kings are wild cards. The team that draws a King can make up a rule that both teams must follow for the rest of the game
   - **Queen**: When a Queen is drawn the opposing team must answer a trivia question about Texas or cowboy culture. If they answer correctly the drawing team drinks. If they miss the question the opposing team drinks
   - **Jack**: Both teams engage in a quick draw. The team leader must chug their drink until the timer runs out
   - **Number Cards (2-10)**: The team that draws the card nominates one member from the opposing team to take that many sips of their drink

3. **Winning the Game**: The game continues until the deck is exhausted or players decide to call it a night. The team with the fewest drinks consumed wins the showdown and earns bragging rights as the ultimate Texas or Cowboy champions

4. **Tie-Breaker**: In the event of a tie both teams nominate one player for a cowboy hat showdown. The nominated players must wear the hat while performing their best cowboy or Texan impression. The group votes on the winner who then claims victory for their team

## Tips for a Legendary Game Night

- **Stay Hydrated**: Make sure to have plenty of water on hand to keep everyone comfortable and safe
- **Snack Time**: Offer some Texan or cowboy-themed snacks to complement the drinks such as nachos or BBQ sliders
- **Music Matters**: Create a playlist of country or Texan tunes to set the mood for your game night
