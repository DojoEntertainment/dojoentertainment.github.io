## Materials Needed

- Shot glasses
- A group of enthusiastic friends

## How to Play

### Step 1 Set the Scene

Gather your friends around a table and ensure everyone has a shot glass filled with soju. If you are not a fan of soju feel free to substitute it with any other beverage of your choice.

### Step 2 Explain the Rules

The game consists of several rounds each with its own set of challenges. The following are some popular rounds inspired by Korean drinking culture

1. **Flick the Cap**

   - Remove the cap from the soju bottle. You will notice a twisted metal piece attached to the cap.
   - Players take turns flicking the twisted metal piece with their fingers.
   - The player who successfully flicks the metal piece off the cap can choose someone to take a shot.

2. **Titanic**

   - Fill a glass halfway with beer.
   - Float an empty shot glass on top of the beer.
   - Players take turns pouring soju into the floating shot glass.
   - The player who sinks the shot glass must drink the entire concoction.

3. **Bunny Bunny**

   - Players sit in a circle and the game starts with one player saying "bunny bunny" twice pointing to another player.
   - The pointed player then repeats "bunny bunny" twice and points to someone else.
   - The players next to the one saying "bunny bunny" must say "ttak ttak" in rhythm.
   - If a player makes a mistake, they take a shot.

4. **3-6-9 Clap Game**

   - Players take turns counting numbers in sequence.
   - Whenever a player reaches a number containing 3, 6, or 9, they must clap instead of saying the number.
   - If a player misses a clap or claps at the wrong time, they take a shot.

### Step 3 Have Fun
