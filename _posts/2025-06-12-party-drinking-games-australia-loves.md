There’s something about an Aussie house party that’s just different—maybe it’s the backyard BBQs, the wild energy, or the fact that someone always ends up doing a shoey. At Drinking Dojo, we know that the heart of any unforgettable bash is a solid lineup of party drinking games. Whether you’re in Melbourne, Sydney, or just channeling that laid-back Aussie vibe from across the globe, we’ve rounded up the best drinking games and dare challenges to turn your next get-together into a legendary event.

### Classic Aussie Drinking Games with a Twist

Australians know how to keep the good times rolling, and these viral drinking games are proof. Grab your mates, your favorite bevvy, and get ready to play!

#### 1. Kings Cup (Ring of Fire)

**Materials:**  
- A standard deck of cards  
- An empty cup (the King’s Cup)  
- Drinks all around  

**How to Play:**  
- Spread the cards in a circle around the King’s Cup.  
- Players take turns drawing cards and perform actions based on the card drawn (e.g., 2 = “You,” pick someone to drink; 8 = “Mate,” choose a drinking buddy).  
- The game is filled with wild dares and meme-worthy moments, especially when the last King is drawn and someone has to drink from the King’s Cup.  

**Why Aussies Love It:**  
This game is legendary for mixing custom rules, savage NSFW dares, and hilarious drinking challenges. It’s a house party staple for a reason!

#### 2. Goon of Fortune

**Materials:**  
- A Hills Hoist clothesline (or any rotary clothesline)  
- A bag of goon (boxed wine)  
- Pegs  

**How to Play:**  
- Peg the goon bag to the clothesline.  
- Players stand in a circle as someone spins the clothesline.  
- Whoever the goon bag lands in front of must take a drink.  

**Pro Tip:**  
Add your own meme drinking games twist by including dare challenges with each spin. For example, before drinking, you have to answer a spicy question or do a wild dare.

#### 3. Flip Cup (Aussie-Style)

**Materials:**  
- Plastic cups  
- Drinks  
- A long table
