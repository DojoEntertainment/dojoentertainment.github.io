Whether Philly is hit with blazing sun, an unexpected downpour, or a snowy surprise, the weather can totally set the mood for your next hangout. But why let the forecast decide your fun? At Drinking Dojo, we say: turn “what’s the weather in Philadelphia?” into your wildest party drinking game yet. From meme-worthy rain delays to heatwave dares, let’s turn any sky into a reason to sip, laugh, and dare your friends.

Below, you’ll find our ultimate weather Philadelphia drinking game, plus ideas to customize your own with our custom drinking game builder. So grab your favorite drinks, rally your crew, and let’s make Philly weather the best excuse ever to game.

## The Weather Philadelphia Party Drinking Game

### What You Need

- Drinks of choice
- A phone for checking the *actual* weather and meme inspiration
- Dare cards or paper to write dares (bonus: use our [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) for instant packs)
- Friends ready for a little chaos

### How To Play

1. **Set Up The Scene**
   - Choose your base: indoors or outside (balconies count!).
   - Pick a “weatherman” who’ll be in charge of announcing Philly’s real-time weather updates.

2. **Assign Weather Triggers**
   - The weatherman checks the current weather in Philadelphia every 15 minutes (or whenever someone shouts “forecast!”).
   - Each type of weather comes with a drinking challenge or dare. Use these, or get creative and build your own!

   **Sample Triggers:**
   - **Sunny**: Everyone does a “cheers to the sun” and takes a sip. The last person to raise their glass must do a meme drinking dare.
   - **Rainy**: Pick someone to make up a rain dance. If they refuse, they take two sips.
   - **Cloudy**: Group votes on the best cloud impression. Winner assigns a drinking challenge.
   - **Thunderstorm**: Everyone shouts their wildest weather-related meme. The quietest has to do an NSFW dare.
   - **Windy**: Last person to “blow” (exhale dramatically) drinks.
   - **Snowy**: Couples in the group do a quick snowball fight (with balled-up napkins or socks). Loser drinks.
   - **Heatwave**: Whoever’s wearing the most layers must remove one (safely!) or chug.

3. **Dare Challenges**
   - Every time the weather changes during your party, the weatherman announces it with a dramatic meme (think: “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia” gifs encouraged).
   - All players must complete a group dare—like singing the Philly anthem, doing a Fortnite dance, or answering a spicy NSFW dare.

4. **Bonus Round**
   - If the weather app says “feels like” something ridiculous (e.g., feels like 100°F), everyone does a shot.
   - For extra meme drinking game energy, add viral challenges—like TikTok dances or impersonating a Philly sports fan after a win.

### House Rules

- **Hydrate**: Water rounds are allowed, especially in heatwave mode.
- **Safety First**: Know your limits—weather can get wild, but stay safe.
- **Customize**: Use our [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) to create local weather triggers or meme dares for your crew.

## Why Weather And Drinking Games Are The Perfect Match

Philly weather is unpredictable, but your party drinking games shouldn’t be. Using the weather as your guide means no two sessions are the same—rain, shine, or snow, your house party ideas stay fresh and hilarious. Plus, you can amp things up with viral drinking games, couples drinking games (hello, snowball fights!), or even wedding party games if you’re celebrating big.

If you’re feeling bold, turn it into a citywide challenge: invite friends from the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and Denmark to join remotely and compare your wildest weather dares.
