## Essential Materials for Mets Game Drinking Games

## Top Mets Game Today Drinking Games and Dare Challenges

### 1. **Classic Inning Sips**

**How to Play:**  
- Every inning, pick a “team captain” to call out game events.  
- Whenever the Mets score, everyone except Mets fans drinks.  
- If the opposing team scores, Mets fans drink.  
- Extra dare: If a player makes an epic catch or blunder, assign a meme-worthy dare challenge.

### 2. **Dare Double-Play**

**How to Play:**  
- Before the game, write out dare challenges (bonus points for NSFW dares or meme drinking games).  
- Every time the Mets turn a double play, the person who last took a drink must complete a dare.  
- If no double plays happen, everyone does a group dare during the seventh-inning stretch.

### 3. **Home Run Hero**

**How to Play:**  
- Pick a “Home Run Hero” each inning.  
- If the Mets hit a home run, the Hero gets to make a rule (think “no saying the word ‘drink’” or “use your non-dominant hand only”).  
- If the other team hits a home run, everyone drinks—and the Home Run Hero completes a dare challenge.

### 4. **Pitcher’s Roulette**

**How to Play:**  
- Assign each friend a Mets player or pitcher.  
- Whenever your player is mentioned by the announcer or makes a play, you take a sip.  
- If your player is pulled from the game, finish your drink or face a dare challenge.
