## How to Play

The game is simple. As you watch the Duke basketball game, follow these rules and take a sip, gulp, or finish your drink accordingly. Remember to drink responsibly and know your limits.

### Rules

1. **Tip-Off Cheers**  
   When the game starts with a tip-off, everyone raises their glass and takes a drink to kick off the festivities.

2. **Three-Point Magic**  
   Every time Duke scores a three-pointer, take a sip. If it is an especially impressive shot, take two sips.

3. **Slam Dunk Delight**  
   Celebrate every Duke slam dunk with a big gulp. If it is an alley-oop, finish your drink.

4. **Free Throw Frenzy**  
   For every successful free throw by Duke, take a sip. If they miss, take two sips to drown your sorrows.

5. **Steal the Show**  
   Whenever Duke steals the ball, take a generous sip. If they score immediately after the steal, finish your drink.

6. **Coach K Cam**  
   Every time the camera focuses on Coach K (or the current Duke coach), take a sip. If he is animatedly coaching, take two sips.

7. **Foul Play**  
   When a Duke player commits a foul, take a sip. If it is a technical foul, take a big gulp.

8. **Timeout Toast**  
   During every timeout, raise your glass and take a drink. Use this time to discuss strategy with your fellow fans.

9. **Victory Celebration**  
   If Duke wins the game, everyone must finish their drink in celebration.

10. **Blue Devils Chant**  
   If the Duke fans in the stands start a chant, join in and take a sip.
