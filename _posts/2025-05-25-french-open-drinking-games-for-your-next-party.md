If you’re looking to ace your next party, why not serve up a little French flair with a twist? The French Open isn’t just about epic tennis rallies and red clay courts—it's the perfect excuse to spice up your hangout with some viral drinking games, dare challenges, and a whole lot of laughs. Whether you're lounging in a dorm room, throwing a house party, or just vibing with your crew, these party drinking games inspired by the French Open are guaranteed to turn any gathering into an unforgettable match point.

## What You Need

Before you start, grab these essentials:
- Your favorite drinks (beer, cocktails, or mocktails—choose your weapon)
- Tennis-themed props (headbands, sweatbands, or even a racquet for dramatic effect)
- A TV or stream of the French Open (optional, but highly recommended for the real vibe)
- Dare cards or a [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) from Drinking Dojo for wild NSFW dares and meme drinking games

## Game 1: Rally Shot Challenge

**How to Play:**
1. Split into two teams—Team Federer and Team Nadal, anyone?
2. Every time a rally goes over 10 shots, everyone takes a sip.
3. If a player smashes an ace, the opposite team drinks.
4. Double faults? The last person to shout "Double!" picks someone to take a dare challenge.
5. If there’s a rain delay or a player loses their temper, everyone does a group toast.

**Perfect for:** House party ideas, wedding party games, or adding spice to your couples drinking games lineup.

## Game 2: Meme Matchup

Bring memes into the mix for a viral drinking game twist!

**How to Play:**
1. Before the match, each player writes down a tennis meme or iconic moment on slips of paper.
2. When something similar happens during the match (e.g., a player slips, argues with the umpire, or the crowd does the wave), everyone who wrote that meme takes a drink.
3. The last person to notice a meme moment must complete a dare from the Drinking Dojo pack (NSFW dares, anyone?).

**Pro tip:** This game is perfect for fans who love a side of chaos with their tennis.

## Game 3: Serve and Swerve Dare Challenge

**How to Play:**
1. Each player “serves” by spinning a bottle to select the next challenger.
2. The chosen player draws a dare card or uses a custom drinking game builder to generate a challenge.
3. Complete the dare or take two drinks as a forfeit.
4. Add bonus rounds for big tennis moments—like a tiebreaker or upset.

**Perfect for:** Breaking the ice at house parties or keeping the energy high during slow match moments.
