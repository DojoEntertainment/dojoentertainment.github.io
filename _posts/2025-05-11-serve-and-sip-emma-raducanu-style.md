#### Materials Needed

#### How to Play

1. **Set Up Your Court**: Gather your friends and find a comfortable spot to watch the match. Ensure everyone has their drink of choice ready.

3. **Rally Cheers**: 
   - During a rally with more than 10 strokes, the last person to cheer takes an extra sip. This keeps everyone engaged and reacting quickly to the game.

4. **Break Point Celebration**:
   - If Emma breaks her opponent's serve, everyone raises their glass and takes a celebratory drink.

5. **Unforced Errors**: 
   - If Emma commits an unforced error, the group collectively decides on a fun challenge for the next break (e.g., a group cheer or a quick trivia question about Emma).

6. **Match Point Madness**:
   - When Emma wins a set, everyone finishes their drink. If she wins the match, it's time for a group toast to her success!

#### Safety First
