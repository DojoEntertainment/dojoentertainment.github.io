NFL games and party drinking games are a match made in tailgate heaven. Whether you’re hosting a house party, vibing with friends, or looking for wild drinking challenges during the big game, there’s no better way to turn touchdowns and turnovers into legendary memories. Ready to level up your next football watch party? Grab your drinks, pick your dare challenges, and let’s dive into some unforgettable drinking games fit for every NFL fan crew.

### Why NFL Games and Drinking Games Just Work

NFL games are long, intense, and packed with meme-worthy moments and viral highlights. That’s the perfect playground for drinking games—especially when you add custom dares or meme drinking games into the mix. From the coin toss to the final whistle, every play can be a reason to sip, chug, or face a hilarious dare challenge.

## Essential Materials for NFL Drinking Games

Here’s what you’ll need to get started:
- Your favorite drinks (beer, cider, cocktails—whatever you love)
- A TV or streaming device for the NFL action
- Printed or digital rules (or use [Drinking Dojo’s custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) for a personalized experience)
- Dare cards or a list of NSFW dares for the wild at heart
- Friends ready for party drinking games

## NFL Drinking Game Rules

Here are the basics—but remember, the more creative, the better. Add your own meme drinking games spin or use the custom drinking game builder to craft your perfect lineup.

### The Classic NFL Sip Game

**Take a sip whenever:**
- A team scores a field goal
- There’s an interception or fumble
- The announcer says “momentum”
- A player does a touchdown dance

**Take two sips if:**
- Your team misses a field goal
- There’s a controversial referee call

**Finish your drink if:**
- The game goes into overtime
- Your team wins on a last-second play

### Dare Challenges for Extra Mayhem

Every quarter, draw a dare card. The person who last checked their phone has to complete it. Keep things spicy with NSFW dares or meme-worthy challenges—like doing your best touchdown dance or DM’ing a random NFL meme to your crush.

### Viral Drinking Games Twist

Add a viral drinking games challenge: Pick a trending NFL meme or moment, and every time it’s mentioned (think: “Butt Fumble”), everyone drinks. Or, make a drinking challenge out of every time a commentator brings up a viral player stat.
