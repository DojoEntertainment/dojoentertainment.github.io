Orlando weather is unpredictable—one minute it’s blue skies, the next it’s a tropical downpour. But why let a little rain (or sweltering sun) put a damper on your party plans? Whether you’re pregaming for a night out in the City Beautiful or hiding out from the humidity, it’s always the right time for unforgettable drinking games. At Drinking Dojo, we’ve got the ultimate party drinking games and dare challenges to turn any Orlando forecast into pure fun.

### Why Play Drinking Games When the Weather in Orlando Gets Weird?

Orlando’s weather is notorious for keeping you on your toes. If you’re stuck inside during a surprise thunderstorm or trying to beat the heat after a day at the parks, drinking games are your ticket to non-stop laughs. From meme drinking games to custom drinking game builders, you can create wild memories with friends—no matter what Mother Nature has in store.

## Top Orlando Weather Drinking Games and How to Play

### 1. **Sunburn Sips**

*Perfect for those days when it’s too hot to step outside but you still want to feel the heat!*

#### **Materials Needed**
- Deck of cards
- Your favorite drinks
- Sun hats, sunglasses (optional but highly encouraged)

#### **Rules**
- Everyone draws a card.  
- Red cards mean you take a sip; black cards, you give a sip.
- If you draw a face card, you must wear a sun hat or sunglasses until someone else draws a face card.
- If someone mentions the weather, everyone does a dare challenge from the Drinking Dojo pack.

**Pro tip:** Spice up the dares with some NSFW dares for adults-only parties!

### 2. **Rain Delay Relay**

*When it starts pouring outside, it’s time to get competitive indoors with this party drinking game.*

#### **Materials Needed**
- Timer or phone stopwatch
- Plastic cups
- Ping pong balls

#### **How to Play**
- Set up two teams. Each team lines up with a cup.
- The first person on each team must bounce a ping pong ball into their cup.
- If they miss, they drink. If they get it in, the next person goes.
- First team to finish wins, and the losing team must complete a dare challenge.

### 3. **Storm Watch Dare Challenges**

*Perfect for those classic Florida thunderstorms—when the thunder hits, the party takes off!*

#### **Materials Needed**
- Dare cards from Drinking Dojo (or use our [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com))
- Drinks for everyone

#### **Rules**

- Bonus: If lightning is spotted, everyone must tell their wildest weather story or take an extra drink.

### 4. **Humidity Hysteria Meme Drinking Game**

*Because Orlando’s humidity is basically a meme at this point.*

#### **Setup**
- Pull up your favorite meme page, or use Drinking Dojo’s meme drinking game pack.
