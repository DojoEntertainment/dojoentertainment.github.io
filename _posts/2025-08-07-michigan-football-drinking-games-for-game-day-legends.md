## Game On: Michigan Football Drinking Game Rules

Here’s your playbook for maximum hype and minimum confusion. This game is all about celebrating big plays, wild blunders, and those meme-worthy moments that make college football epic.

### What You’ll Need

- Your favorite drinks (keep it responsible!)
- A TV or stream showing the Michigan football game
- Printed or digital rules (save this post!)
- Optional: Drinking Dojo’s [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) for even more wild dares and challenges

### How to Play

**Set Up:**  
Gather everyone before kickoff. Let each person pick a Michigan player to “represent” for extra competitive spice.

#### The Basic Rules

**Take a sip when:**
- Michigan gets a first down  
- The commentator mentions “The Big House”  
- There’s a close-up of a fan with face paint  
- You spot a Michigan meme sign in the crowd  
- The band plays “Hail to the Victors”  

**Finish your drink if:**
- There’s a pick-six (interception returned for a touchdown)  
- Michigan blocks a field goal or punt  
- The game goes into overtime  
- A coach loses their headset in frustration

**Dare Challenges:**
- If Michigan fumbles, the last person to shout “Butterfingers!” must do a dare (think NSFW dares if your party’s up for it!)
- Whenever the mascot does something meme-worthy, start a mini dance-off—loser takes a double dare

#### Meme Drinking Game Extras

Add some meme drinking games flavor by picking a viral football meme before kickoff. Every time something happens that would make that meme relevant (say, a coach’s epic reaction or a ref’s questionable call), everyone drinks.

#### Bonus Wedding Party or House Party Ideas

- Pair up for couples drinking games: whenever your “player” scores or makes a big play, your partner has to take a sip.
- For bigger crowds, make it a tournament—last team standing at the end of the game gets bragging rights (and maybe a dare challenge or two).

## Pro Tips for Unforgettable Game Days

- Stay hydrated—seriously.
- Mix in non-alcoholic rounds to keep the party going safely.
