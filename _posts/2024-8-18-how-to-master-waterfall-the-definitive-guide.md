Waterfall is a timeless drinking game, perfect for getting everyone involved in a fun, interactive way. But to truly enjoy the game, you need to know the rules inside out. This definitive rulebook will walk you through everything you need to know to master Waterfall and keep the party going strong.

## Waterfall Drinking Game Rules
### Setup:
Players sit in a circle with a deck of cards placed in the center. Each player should have a drink ready.

### Basic Rules:
- **Ace:** Everyone drinks.
- **2 to 9:** The player who draws the card chooses someone else to drink a corresponding number of sips.
- **10:** The player must start a waterfall, where everyone begins drinking at the same time. No one can stop until the person to their left stops.
- **Jack:** The player who draws this card must create a rule that everyone must follow for the rest of the game (e.g., no saying the word “drink”).
- **Queen:** The player asks a question to another player. That player must respond with a question, and the round continues until someone fails to ask a question or hesitates. The person who fails drinks.
- **King:** The player adds some of their drink to a cup in the center. The person who draws the fourth King drinks whatever is in the cup.

## Popular Variations:
- **Reverse Waterfall:** Start the waterfall with the person to the right of the card drawer instead of the left.
- **Double Trouble:** Add a second deck of cards for more chaos and fun.
- **Theme Edition:** Play with a theme, such as superheroes or movies, and create special rules related to that theme.
