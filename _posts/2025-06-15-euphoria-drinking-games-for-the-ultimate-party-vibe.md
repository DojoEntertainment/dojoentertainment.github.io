And nothing cranks up that energy quite like unforgettable drinking games. Whether you’re vibing at a house party, prepping for a wedding bash, or just chilling with your squad, our euphoria-inspired drinking games are your ticket to a euphoric night.

## Why Euphoria and Drinking Games Are the Perfect Match

Euphoria is all about living in the moment, embracing chaos, and making memories that’ll have you laughing for weeks. The right party drinking games can turn even a low-key get-together into a wild adventure. From meme drinking games to dare challenges, the options are endless—and so is the fun.

Ready to bring the euphoria? Here’s our favorite way to do it.

## How To Play Euphoria: The Ultimate Meme and Dare Drinking Game

### What You’ll Need

- A group of friends (3+ for max chaos)
- Drinks of your choice (keep it safe, folks)
- A phone or laptop for meme prompts and dares  
- Custom drinking game builder (check out [Drinking Dojo’s custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) for ultimate flexibility)

### Setting Up

1. **Gather your crew:** The more, the wilder.
2. **Decide your vibe:** Are you going for viral drinking games, meme challenges, or spicy NSFW dares?
3. **Build your deck:** Use the custom drinking game builder to mix meme drinking games, dare challenges, and classic rules. Or grab a ready-made Drinking Dojo pack.

### Game Rules

1. **Draw a Card:** Each turn, one player draws a card (physical, digital, or meme prompt).
2. **Read it Out Loud:** Could be a dare, a meme caption challenge, or a classic drinking rule.
3. **Complete the Challenge:**
    - **If it’s a meme:** Everyone must come up with a caption. The best gets to assign drinks.
    - **If it’s a dare challenge:** Complete the dare or drink.
    - **If it’s a rule:** Everyone follows the rule until the next card. (Example: “No names allowed, or you drink!”)
4. **Pass the Device/Deck:** Next player draws and the mayhem continues.

## Example Euphoria Game Cards

- **Meme Madness:** Find a trending meme, show it to the group, and everyone must create the funniest caption. Winner assigns three drinks.
- **NSFW Dare:** Swap an item of clothing with someone at the table or take two sips.
- **Wedding Party Twist:** Toast the “happy couple”—if you mess up, finish your drink!
- **Fortnite Drinking Game:** Last person to floss has to drink.
- **Wild Card:** Invent a new rule for the group (like “no pointing” or “talk in accents”).

## House Rules for Maximum Euphoria

- **Stay hydrated.** Water in between rounds is your best friend.
- **Consent is key.** If a dare goes too far, skip it—no shame, just fun.
- **Keep it social.** These games are about epic memories, not just the drinks.
