Looking for party drinking games that break the ice, spark wild dares, and get everyone laughing? If you want to add some viral drinking games to your next house party or pregame, the Georgia Lottery drinking game is your ticket to unforgettable chaos. Whether you’re in a college dorm in Atlanta, a wedding afterparty in London, or just vibing with mates in Sydney, this meme drinking game brings the thrill of lottery luck to your night—minus the scratch-off disappointment.

## What is the Georgia Lottery Drinking Game?

Imagine the suspense of the lottery, but instead of cash prizes, you score sips, shots, or wild dare challenges. This party drinking game is built for groups who want to mix luck, risk, and a little meme magic. No need to be a math genius or a lottery pro—just bring your favorite drinks, some scratch-off tickets (optional), and your wildest friends.

## Materials You’ll Need

- Drinks of choice (beer, cocktails, mocktails—whatever your crew fancies)  
- A stack of Georgia Lottery scratch-off tickets (or any lottery tickets from your region)  
- Shot glasses or cups  
- A bowl or hat  
- Slips of paper for dares (think NSFW dares, classic challenges, or viral meme drinking games tasks)  
- Pens/markers

## Setting Up the Game

1. **Prep the Dare Slips**: Write dares or drinking challenges on slips of paper. Get creative—think wedding party games, couples drinking games, or Fortnite drinking game tasks if you want to spice it up.  
2. **Ticket Time**: Place lottery tickets in a bowl or spread them out face-down on a table.  
3. **Shuffle the Order**: Decide who goes first—last person to win anything in a real lottery, maybe?

## How to Play

### Basic Rules

1. **Draw Your Fate**  
   On your turn, pick a lottery ticket from the bowl or table.

2. **Scratch and Sip**  
   Scratch the ticket:  
   - **Win anything**? YOU get to hand out drinks equal to the dollar value of your win. (If you win $5, hand out 5 sips or shots. If it’s a big win, spread the love!)  
   - **Lose?** Draw a dare slip and complete the challenge or drink.

3. **The Wild Card Rule**  
   If your ticket has a “free ticket” prize, everyone at the table has to take a sip—because everyone gets a little lucky.

4. **Bonus Rounds**  
   - **NSFW dares** for those who want to up the ante.  
   - Meme drinking games: Add viral meme challenges for extra laughs (think “do your best TikTok dance while holding a drink”).  
   - For couples: Turn dares into couples drinking games—swap dares, share secrets, or play truth-or-dare style.

5. **Keep Going**  
   Play until the tickets run out, the drinks are gone, or the dares get too wild to handle.
