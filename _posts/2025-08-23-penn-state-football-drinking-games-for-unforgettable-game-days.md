Penn State football Saturdays are pretty much a holiday in State College—and honestly, anywhere you’ve got fans repping blue and white. But whether you’re tailgating outside Beaver Stadium, taking over a house party, or pregaming with your crew, there’s one surefire way to bring even more hype: party drinking games.

If you’re hunting for new house party ideas or want to spice up your next game day, we’ve got you covered with the ultimate Penn State football drinking games. Get ready for meme drinking games, dare challenges, and custom drinking game builder tips to make every touchdown a total win.

## The Ultimate Penn State Football Drinking Game

### What You’ll Need

- A TV or stream of the Penn State game (duh)  
- Your favorite drinks (beer, seltzer, cocktails—hydration is key)  
- Cups or shot glasses  
- Optional: blue and white face paint for full send energy  

### Game Rules

This one’s perfect for veteran party animals and first-timers alike. Here’s how to play:

#### Basic Play

1. **Pregame Picks**: Before kickoff, everyone picks a player (or coach) to “follow.” Whenever your person is mentioned, you drink.  
2. **First Down Funsies**: Every time Penn State gets a first down, everyone takes a sip.  
3. **Touchdown Toasts**: Penn State scores? Cheers and finish your drink (or take a shot, if you’re brave).  
4. **Flag On The Play**: If there’s a penalty, the last person to shout “We Are!” takes a dare challenge.  
5. **Wild Meme Moment**: If a meme-worthy moment happens (think mascot shenanigans, wild crowd shots, or a classic Big Ten weather fail), the person who notices it first can make a custom rule for the next five minutes.  
6. **Halftime Dare**: At halftime, pick a dare from a deck or app—bonus points for NSFW dares if your party’s into it.  

#### Extra Points (Bonus Rules)

- **Announcer’s Catchphrase**: Whenever the announcer says “whiteout,” everyone drinks.  
- **Opponent Fumbles**: If the other team fumbles, choose someone to finish their drink.  
- **Overtime Madness**: If the game goes to overtime, everyone takes a group “victory lap” (finish your drinks and shout “Go Lions!”).  

## Make It Viral With Dare Challenges

Want to go next-level? Up the ante with viral drinking games or meme drinking games that get your crew trending on TikTok or Instagram. Film your wildest dares (safely, of course) and use a custom drinking game builder to create challenges like:

- **Mascot Karaoke**: Sing the Penn State fight song after a touchdown.  
- **Halftime Fortnite**: Quick round of a Fortnite drinking game during halftime for double the chaos.  
- **Couples Drinking Games**: If you’ve got pairs in the crew, make custom dares for couples—like coordinated touchdown dances.  

## Tips For Safe And Wild Game Day Fun

- **Pace Yourself**: It’s a marathon, not a sprint—hydration breaks are clutch.  
- **Know Your Limits**: Dare challenges are for fun, not peer pressure.  
- **Be Responsible**: Always have a plan to get home safe, no matter how wild the party gets.
