Whether you’re celebrating snagging new kicks or just want to turn your shopping spree into a legendary night, we’ve got you covered with the ultimate guide to drinking games, dare challenges, and viral meme drinking games. Grab your crew, your favorite beverages, and let’s make this tax free weekend unforgettable.

### Why Tax Free Weekend in Ohio is the Perfect Party Vibe

Let’s be real: after a long day of scoring deals, you deserve to let loose. Tax free weekend isn’t just about shopping; it’s about the perfect excuse to gather your friends, share some laughs, and maybe tackle a few drinking challenges. This is your green light to turn a regular night into a party drinking game marathon.

### Essential Materials for Your Tax Free Weekend Bash

Before you start, set the mood:
- Drinks of choice (bonus points for Ohio-made brews!)
- Shot glasses or cups
- A deck of cards (or your phone for custom drinking game builders)
- Dare challenge cards (DIY or [download from Drinking Dojo](https://drinkingdojo.com))
- Bluetooth speaker for meme-worthy music
- Snacks for when the munchies hit

### Classic Drinking Games for Your Ohio Bash

#### 1. Kings Cup: Tax Free Edition

**How to Play:**
- Spread a deck of cards in a circle around a large cup (the “King’s Cup”).
- Players take turns drawing cards, each one tied to a rule:
  - Ace: Waterfall (everyone drinks in order)
  - 2: You (choose someone to drink)
  - 3: Me (you drink)
  - 4: Floor (last to touch the floor drinks)
- Make it Ohio-themed: Every time someone mentions their best deal or a shopping fail, they assign a dare challenge.

#### 2. Dare Roulette

Mix up the fun with viral drinking games and dares.
- Write NSFW dares, meme drinking games prompts, or “tax-free” challenges on slips of paper.
- Players spin a bottle; whoever it lands on draws a dare and must complete it or drink.
- Keep it spicy with challenges like “Imitate a bargain-hunting grandma” or “Do your best TikTok dance with a shopping bag as a prop.”

#### 3. Custom Drinking Game Builder

Create your own personalized party drinking games with prompts relevant to your tax free shopping haul:
- Add rules like “If you bought shoes, take two sips” or “If you stood in line for over 30 minutes, nominate someone to finish their drink.”
- Use the [Drinking Dojo custom builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) to make your own pack in seconds.

### Trending Drinking Challenges for Your Crew

Bring in some viral fun:
- **Fortnite drinking game:** For the gamers in your squad, play a round of Fortnite—every elimination or victory means someone drinks.
- **Couples drinking games:** Perfect for post-shopping date nights or double dates.
- **Wedding party games:** Just got engaged at the mall? Celebrate with a round of meme drinking games!

### Pro Tips for an Epic Ohio Party

- Hydrate between rounds (water is your friend).
- Keep snacks handy—shopping and sipping is hungry work.
- Always have a designated driver or rideshare app ready.
