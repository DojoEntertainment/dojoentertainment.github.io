The annual [Boston St Patrick's Day Parade](https://drinkingdojo.com) is a spectacle of green, joy, and camaraderie that draws thousands of revelers to the streets of Beantown. While the parade itself is a feast for the senses, why not elevate your celebration by introducing some festive drinking games? These games will keep the energy high and ensure your group has a memorable day. Read on to discover a few themed drinking games perfect for this iconic event.

### 1. Shamrock Shuffle

#### How to Play:
Gather your group and head to a spot where you can comfortably watch the parade. Each participant picks a parade-related keyword such as "leprechaun," "shamrock," or "green." Every time the chosen word is mentioned by a fellow reveler or spotted on a float, the person who picked that word takes a sip.

#### Rules:
- Choose distinct keywords to avoid confusion.
- If someone misses a mention of their keyword, they take two sips as a penalty.
- The game ends when the parade is over or when participants decide they've had enough fun.

#### Materials:
- A beverage of choice for each participant
- A list of parade-related keywords

### 2. Pot o' Gold Toss

#### How to Play:
This game is a combination of skill and luck. Set up a small "pot of gold" (a cup or small bucket) at a distance. Each player takes turns tossing a coin or small bean bag into the pot. If successful, the player assigns sips to others. If they miss, they take a sip themselves.

#### Rules:
- Decide on the number of sips assigned for a successful toss.
- Keep the playing area safe and free of obstacles.
- Rotate turns to ensure everyone gets a chance to play.

#### Materials:
- Coins or small bean bags
- A cup or small bucket

### 3. Leprechaun's Lure

#### How to Play:
As the parade progresses, players must spot and call out various parade elements. Create a shared list of items to find, like a man in a kilt, a rainbow flag, or a dancing leprechaun. The first person to spot an item assigns a sip to another player.

#### Rules:
- Each item can only be called once.
- Keep the game friendly and fun.
- Ensure everyone has a chance to participate by spacing out calls.

#### Materials:
- A shared list of parade elements
- A beverage of choice for each participant
