## Why Sturgis Vibes Make Epic Drinking Games

Sturgis is all about freedom, fun, and pushing boundaries, which is exactly the vibe you want when picking out party drinking games.

Let’s break out the custom drinking game builder and kick things up a notch.

## Must-Try Sturgis Drinking Games

### 1. **Throttle or Bottle**

This viral drinking game is a guaranteed crowd-pleaser and super easy to set up.

**What You Need:**
- Drinks (your choice)
- Deck of cards
- Speaker for blasting tunes

**How to Play:**
1. **Shuffle the Deck:** Spread the cards in a circle.
2. **Music Up:** Play your best Sturgis-inspired playlist.
3. **Pick and Dare:** Each player draws a card. Red cards mean “Throttle”—the player has to do a dare challenge (think wild, meme drinking games style, or NSFW dares for the brave). Black cards mean “Bottle”—take a drink!
4. **Double Trouble:** Draw a joker? You pick someone else to do both a dare and a drink.

**Tips:** Need fresh dare challenges? Use the [Drinking Dojo custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) to mix up your own!

Perfect for big parties or wedding party games, Sturgis Showdown brings out everyone’s competitive spirit.

**What You Need:**
- Two “teams” (bikers vs. everyone else, or any fun rivalry)
- Shot glasses
- List of hilarious challenges (think Fortnite drinking game tasks, dance-offs, or meme drinking games)

**Rules:**
- Teams take turns drawing a challenge.
- If a team completes it, the other team drinks.
- Refuse a challenge? Drink twice.
- First team to back out loses and has to perform a group dare.

### 3. **Ride or Chug**

For those who love quick, fiery rounds, Ride or Chug is your go-to.

**What You Need:**
- Drinks
- Timer (phone works great)

**How to Play:**
- Set the timer for one minute.
- Players take turns sharing a wild Sturgis story, real or made up.
- If anyone laughs or interrupts, they drink.
- At the end of the minute, group votes: best story forces everyone else to take a drink.

## House Party Ideas to Keep the Sturgis Spirit Alive
