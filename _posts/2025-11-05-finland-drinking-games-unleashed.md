Looking for party drinking games that go way beyond beer pong? Let’s talk about how Finland keeps spirits high and the dares wild, even in the land of midnight sun and arctic nights. If you’re ready to bring a little Finnish flavor to your next house party, wedding rager, or pregame, we’ve got you covered with viral drinking games, meme drinking games, and custom drinking game builder ideas that are guaranteed to level up your night.

## Why Finland Is the Secret Ingredient for Epic Drinking Games

Finnish parties are legendary for their mix of laid-back vibes and absolute mayhem. The Finns have a knack for turning everyday moments into unforgettable drinking challenges. Whether you’re chilling with friends or plotting your next house party, these games bring people together and push everyone just a little out of their comfort zone.

## Must-Try Finnish Drinking Games

### 1. **Känni-Karaoke** (Drunk Karaoke)

**Materials Needed:**  
- A karaoke setup (or just YouTube and a phone)  
- Drinks of your choice

**How to Play:**  
1. Everyone draws a song from a hat (or lets the group pick a song for them).  
2. Before each performance, the singer has to complete a dare challenge—think NSFW dares or meme-inspired tasks.  
3. Miss a lyric or chicken out? Take a drink and try again, or let the group come up with a fun penalty.

This game is pure viral drinking game energy and can be customized with our [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) for your crew’s favorite tracks and dares.

### 2. **Mölkky With a Twist**

**Materials Needed:**  
- A Mölkky set (or substitute with numbered bottles/cups)  
- Drinks

**How to Play:**  
1. Set up the pins (or bottles) and mark the throwing line.  
2. Each player throws the stick and tries to knock down pins.  
3. Knock over a pin, and assign drinks based on its number.  
4. Miss all pins? That’s a hefty dare challenge coming your way—draw from a dare deck or let the crew decide.

Great for outdoor house party ideas or summer BBQs in the US, UK, Canada, Australia, or Denmark.

### 3. **Sauna Sips**

**Materials Needed:**  
- Access to a sauna (or improvise with a steamy bathroom)  
- Drinks

**How to Play:**  
1. Everyone sits in the sauna with their drink.  
2. The host reads out meme drinking games questions or funny “Never Have I Ever” prompts.  
3. Anyone who’s done the thing drinks and has to share a quick story.  
4. The last one left in the sauna without tapping out gets to invent a new rule for the group.

Perfect for wedding party games or couples drinking games with a twist.
