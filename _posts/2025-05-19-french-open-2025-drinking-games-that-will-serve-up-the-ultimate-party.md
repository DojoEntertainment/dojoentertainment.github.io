## Game On Serve Up the French Open Drinking Game

You don’t need a clay court or pro-level backhand to make this game a smash. All you need is a TV, drinks, your hyped-up crew, and a pinch of mayhem.

### What You’ll Need

- Any match from the French Open 2025 (stream or TV)
- Your favorite drinks (wine for the Paris vibes, beers, cocktails — you do you)
- Dare cards or a [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) for extra spice
- Tennis memes on standby (optional but highly encouraged)
- Pens and paper (for NSFW dares or keeping score)

## How to Play The French Open 2025 Drinking Game Rules

This game is all about keeping things wild, competitive, and a little unpredictable — just like the tournament itself.

### Basic Rules

**Take a sip when:**
- The camera zooms in on a player wiping sweat off their brow.
- Someone shouts “Allez!” or any other hype phrase.
- A player challenges a call (bonus points if they overreact).
- The umpire says “Let” or “Out.”
- A commentator mentions clay, weather, or “the Paris crowd.”

**Finish your drink when:**
- There’s a rain delay.
- A player smashes their racquet.
- Someone wins the set with a tiebreak.

**Dare Challenge**
- At the start, everyone draws a dare from the pile. If your player double faults, you must complete the dare (NSFW dares encouraged for the brave).
- Dares can be pulled from a meme drinking games pack or made up on the spot (think: “Speak with a French accent until the next point” or “Post a tennis meme to your group chat”).

**Wildcard Custom Rule**
- Use the custom drinking game builder to add in house party ideas or drinking challenges based on your group’s inside jokes or favorite players. For extra chaos, create a couples drinking game rule for every mixed doubles match!
