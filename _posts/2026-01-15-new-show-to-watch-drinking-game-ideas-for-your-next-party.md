Looking for a new show to watch and a fresh way to make your next party unforgettable? Why not combine both with the ultimate drinking games inspired by your favorite binge-worthy series? Whether you’re vibing in a dorm room, hosting a house party, or planning a wedding after-party, these party drinking games will kick your night into high gear. Grab your crew, pick your new obsession, and get ready for dares, memes, and some seriously viral drinking games action.

## Why Pair TV With Drinking Games?

Let’s face it—sometimes, watching a new show to watch is better with friends, snacks, and a little party chaos. Drinking games take any ordinary binge session and turn it into a wild, unforgettable experience. You’ll create inside jokes, tackle dare challenges, and maybe even start your own viral drinking games trend. Plus, with tools like our [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com), you can make every episode a new adventure.

## How To Play The New Show To Watch Drinking Game

Here’s how to turn any show into a legendary party drinking game, whether you’re into reality TV, epic dramas, or meme-worthy sitcoms.

### What You Need

- A TV or laptop with your show of choice queued up  
- Your favorite drinks (cocktails, beer, seltzers, or mocktails—your call)  
- Cups for everyone  
- Dare challenges written on slips of paper (optional but highly recommended for mayhem)  
- A group of fun-loving friends (2+ players works best)

### Setting Up

1. **Pick Your Show:** Choose a new show to watch that everyone’s excited about. Popular choices include anything trending on Netflix, Hulu, or BBC iPlayer.  
2. **Set The Rules:** Decide if you’ll use the classic rules below, add custom meme drinking games twists, or use our [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) to create your own.  
3. **Prepare The Dares:** Jot down NSFW dares, funny challenges, or meme-worthy moments on slips of paper to draw when someone loses a round.

### Basic Rules

Whenever the following happens in your show, everyone drinks:

- **Character Catchphrases:** Take a sip every time someone says their signature line.  
- **Plot Twists:** Take two drinks for surprise reveals or dramatic moments.  
- **Meme Moments:** Finish your drink if a scene goes viral or becomes a meme in your group chat.  
- **Awkward Silences:** Challenge someone to draw a dare and perform it.  
- **Relationship Drama:** Take a drink every time a couple argues, kisses, or breaks up (great for couples drinking games).

### Dare Challenges

Want to raise the stakes? Every fifth drink, the last person to take a sip has to draw a dare. Some ideas:

- Do your best impression of a main character.  
- Make up a new catchphrase for the show.  
- Take a selfie with your drink and post it to your story with the hashtag #DrinkingDojo.  
- Attempt a Fortnite dance (yes, even at a wedding party).
