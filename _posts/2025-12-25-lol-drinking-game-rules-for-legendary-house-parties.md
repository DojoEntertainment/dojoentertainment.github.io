Whether you’re pregaming for a night out, spicing up your next wedding party, or just vibing with your mates, this game is guaranteed to bring the party—and the memes.

Forget boring party drinking games. This one’s got viral drinking game energy, meme drinking game vibes, and plenty of wild dare challenges to keep the crew buzzing. Ready to LOL (and maybe regret a few decisions tomorrow)? Read on.

## What You Need for the Ultimate Party Drinking Games

- **A group of 3+ players** (the more, the messier) — perfect for house party ideas or couples drinking games alike.
- **Plenty of drinks** (beer, cocktails, soda—your choice) to keep the drinking challenges rolling.
- **A meme generator app** or meme cards (optional, but hilarious) to add viral and meme drinking games flavor.
- **Your phone** (for custom drinking game builder tools or dares) to access Drinking Dojo’s unique dare challenges.
- **A sense of humor** (mandatory) because this game thrives on laughs and wild moments.

## How To Play The LOL Drinking Game: Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Set the Seating for Your Party Drinking Games

Circle up, couch fort optional. Each player gets their drink and their phone. Designate one player as the first “Meme Master.” Ideal for US, UK, Canada, Australia, and Denmark party scenes.

### 2. The Meme Master’s Challenge

The Meme Master picks a meme (from an app, meme card, or their brain) and presents it to the group. It can be a classic, a deep cut, or something totally NSFW if your group is up for it.

### 3. Try Not To Laugh and Avoid Drinking Challenges

On the count of three, everyone looks at the meme. No laughing, smirking, snickering, or even grinning allowed. Anyone who cracks—even a little—takes a drink.

### 4. Dare Challenges for Next-Level Fun

The Meme Master picks one person who laughed hardest or last and gives them a dare challenge. (Need inspiration? Use Drinking Dojo’s [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) to whip up spicy dares on the spot.)

- **NSFW dares** optional, but encouraged for 18+ crowds.
- Safe dares for the wild but shy: sing your latest text out loud, do your best British accent, or text your crush a meme.

### 5. Pass The Meme Master

After each round, the role of Meme Master rotates left. Keep going until everyone’s laughed, dared, and embarrassed themselves at least once.

## Extra LOL Variations for Viral Drinking Games and More

- **Fortnite Drinking Game Remix**: Every time someone references Fortnite or does a dance move, everyone drinks. A must-try for gamers.
- **Wedding Party Games Edition**: Use inside jokes or memes about the couple to elevate your wedding party games.
- **Election Day Drinking Game**: Watch political memes—every time someone groans, it’s time to sip. Perfect for election day drinking game enthusiasts.

## Why This Game Slaps in the World of Drinking Challenges

- **Perfect for any vibe**: From house party ideas to chill hangouts or couples drinking games.
- **Viral drinking game potential**: Memes + dares = next-level content for your stories and social feeds.
