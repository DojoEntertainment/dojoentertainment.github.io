## Columbus Day Party Drinking Game

### What You’ll Need

- Any kind of drinks (beers, seltzers, cocktails, or mocktails)
- A deck of cards
- Sticky notes
- Pens
- A sense of adventure (pirate hats are optional, but highly encouraged)

### How To Play: "Sail The Seven Shots"

This meme-worthy party drinking game is all about celebrating discoveries, daring challenges, and a little dose of mayhem.

#### Setup

1. **Create Your Map:**  
   On sticky notes, write down fun NSFW dares, wild challenges, and meme drinking tasks (think: “Speak in a pirate accent for 5 minutes” or “Share your best travel meme—loser drinks”).
2. **Spread The Notes:**  
   Stick them around the room like hidden treasures.
3. **Deal The Cards:**  
   Each player gets five cards.

#### Game Rules

- **Draw & Discover:**  
  On your turn, draw a card. If it’s a red card, you must hunt for a sticky note and complete the dare or challenge.
- **Black Cards Mean Sips:**  
  Draw a black card? Take two sips and pass your turn.
- **Jokers Are Wild:**  
  Found a joker? You get to make your own dare for someone else.
- **King Of Columbus:**  
  The first player to complete three dares becomes the “King (or Queen) of Columbus” and can make a group rule everyone must follow for the next 10 minutes.

## Dare Challenges To Spice Up The Game

- Mimic the worst explorer accent until your next turn
- Share your most embarrassing travel story (if you refuse, drink twice)
- Make a toast to “discoveries”—most creative wins, loser drinks
- Create a meme on the spot using only props in the room
- Challenge another player to a quick “fortnite drinking game” dance-off (loser drinks)
