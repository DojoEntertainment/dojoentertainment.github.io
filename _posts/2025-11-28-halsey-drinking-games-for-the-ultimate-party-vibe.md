Whether you’re vibing with friends in your dorm or lighting up a wedding afterparty, these Halsey-inspired drinking games will bring the mayhem, memes, and dares you crave. Grab your squad, hit shuffle, and let the games begin!

## What You’ll Need

- Your favorite drinks (cocktails, beers, or mocktails—your call)
- A speaker and a Halsey playlist (Spotify, YouTube, Apple Music, it’s all good)
- Dare cards (DIY with paper, or use our [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com))
- Shot glasses or cups
- Paper and pen (for keeping score or tracking epic dares)

## Halsey Song Sip-Off

This party drinking game is all about listening for Halsey’s iconic lyrics and wild beats. Perfect for house parties, wedding party games, or just a Friday night with your besties.

### How To Play

1. **Create a Halsey Playlist:** Queue up all the hits—think “Without Me,” “Bad at Love,” “Eastside,” and more.
2. **Assign Rules:** Before each song, pick a rule that everyone has to follow. Here are some ideas:
   - Take a sip every time Halsey sings the word “love.”
   - Finish your drink if a featured artist starts singing.
   - Do a dare challenge if someone sings along off-key.
   - If anyone guesses the wrong song title, they draw from the dare card pile.
3. **Play On Shuffle:** Keeps everyone on their toes, and ups the meme drinking games vibes.
4. **Dare Time:** When a song with an explicit lyric comes on, the group votes on someone to do an NSFW dare (as wild as you want to go!).
5. **Keep Score:** Track who’s crushing the challenges or racking up the most dares—winner gets bragging rights or a custom dare.

## Couples Drinking Games With a Halsey Twist

For a duo date night or a fun pregame, try these:

- Sip together every time Halsey sings about heartbreak.
- Challenge each other to a dance-off when the chorus hits—loser does a dare or takes a shot.
- Use our custom drinking game builder to create your own NSFW dares inspired by Halsey lyrics.

## Make It Viral
