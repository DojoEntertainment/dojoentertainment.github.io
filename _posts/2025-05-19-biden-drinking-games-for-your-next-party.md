Ready to take your next party from “meh” to legendary? If there’s one thing the Drinking Dojo crew knows, it’s how to turn any headline, meme, or moment into the wildest party drinking games out there. Enter: Biden drinking games. Whether you’re glued to a State of the Union, watching election night drama unfold, or just looking for a new viral drinking game to crack your squad up, this is your ticket to unforgettable nights.

## Why Biden Drinking Games Are a Must-Try

Presidential moments are made for memes, hot takes, and—let’s be real—dare challenges that’ll have everyone losing it. Mixing politics and parties might sound risky, but with the right rules (and a sense of humor), you’ll have the ultimate house party idea that works for everything from election day drinking games to chill Friday hangouts.

## What You’ll Need

- Drinks for everyone (boozy or booze-free, your call)
- TV, laptop, or phone to stream Biden speeches or events (Inauguration Day, big press conferences, or meme-worthy appearances all work)
- Dare cards or a custom drinking game builder from [Drinking Dojo](https://drinkingdojo.com)
- A group of friends who are down for some wild NSFW dares—or keep it PG, your choice

## How to Play: Biden Drinking Game Rules

### The Basics

1. **Pick Your Stream**: Queue up a Biden moment—State of the Union, inauguration, or a viral interview.
2. **Deal the Dare Challenges**: Use your favorite meme drinking games pack, or build your own with our custom drinking game builder.
3. **Set the Rules**: Decide on your drinks per turn, and how wild you want the dare challenges to get.

### Core Rules

- **Drink When…**
    - Biden says “Folks”
    - He pauses dramatically
    - Anyone mentions “unity”
    - The camera zooms in on his aviator sunglasses
    - He tells a childhood story
- **Dare Challenge When…**
    - He makes a meme-worthy face (cue everyone to pull their best impression)
    - Someone yells “C’mon, man!” (extra shot for the last to react)
    - There’s a viral moment on social media (pull a random dare from the deck)
- **Finish Your Drink If…**
    - He calls someone “Jack”
    - He runs up (or down) the stairs

### Next Level: NSFW or Couples Drinking Games

Want to spice it up? Toss in some NSFW dares or flip the script for couples drinking games—think “Kiss the person to your left if Biden cracks a joke” or “Send a meme to your ex if you miss a cue.”

## Bonus: Election Day and Inauguration Day Drinking Game Twists

- **Election Day**: Drink every time a state flips, or a pundit says “too close to call.”
- **Inauguration Day**: Sip when the crowd chants, finish your drink if there’s an unexpected celeb cameo.

## Make It Your Own
