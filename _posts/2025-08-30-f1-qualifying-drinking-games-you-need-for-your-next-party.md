Ready to spice up your next pregame or house party with something that’ll make everyone remember the night (at least, most of it)? It’s time to bring the thrill of F1 qualifying to your living room with the ultimate party drinking games. Whether you’re a true motorsport fan or just love a wild dare challenge, this one’s for you.

Forget the old-school rules—at Drinking Dojo, we believe in meme drinking games, viral drinking games, and custom twists that get the energy pumping. Buckle up, because this is how you turn F1 qualifying into the best party drinking game ever.

## What You Need

- Your favorite drinks (beer, cocktails, or whatever fuels your need for speed)
- F1 qualifying live stream or replay (YouTube, cable, or streaming)
- Dare challenges (write a few down or use our [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com))
- Scorecards (optional, but fun)
- Pens, paper, and a wild group of friends

## How To Play F1 Qualifying Drinking Games

### 1. Choose Your Drivers

Everyone picks a driver before qualifying starts. If you’ve got a big group, double up or assign drivers randomly for extra chaos.

### 2. Set Your Rules

Here are the classic Drinking Dojo rules for F1 qualifying party drinking games:

- **Every Overtake in Qualifying:** Take a sip.
- **Driver Knocked Out:** If your chosen driver gets knocked out (Q1, Q2, or Q3), finish your drink or take a dare challenge.
- **Fastest Lap:** Everyone has to do a group toast and take a shot.
- **Red Flag:** Last person to raise their hand does an NSFW dare or drinks twice.
- **Commentator Says “Track Evolution”:** Everyone drinks.
- **Fortnite Dance-Off:** When a camera catches a wild fan in a costume, do your best Fortnite dance—winner gives out drinks.

### 3. Spin The Dare Wheel

Between each qualifying session, spin a wheel or pull a card for a wild dare challenge. Think meme drinking games like:

- “Talk in a British accent until the next commercial”
- “Text your ex a F1 meme”
- “Do your best race car impression and post it on social media”

### 4. The Final Grid

At the end of qualifying, whoever’s driver is on pole gets to make a house rule for the afterparty. Last place? They have to complete the ultimate dare—chosen by the group.

These party drinking games are perfect for house party ideas, wedding party games, or just vibing with your crew. Plus, with our custom drinking game builder, you can make it as wild or as tame as you want. Add in viral drinking games, meme moments, and NSFW dares for the ultimate night.
