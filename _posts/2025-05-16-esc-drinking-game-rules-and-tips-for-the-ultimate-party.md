If you’re hunting for party drinking games that spark wild memories, “esc” is your next must-try. This viral drinking game is easy to set up, brings instant laughs, and is perfect whether you're at a house party, wedding rager, or just vibing in the dorm. Get ready for a mix of dare challenges, NSFW dares, and meme-worthy moments that’ll make your night unforgettable.

## What Is Esc?

“Esc” is the drinking game for anyone who loves a little chaos with their cocktails. The premise is simple: when someone wants to escape an awkward moment, a dare, or a drinking challenge, they can “press esc” — but not without a twist. With every escape, there’s a price to pay.

## What You Need

- **A group of friends** (3+ is ideal)
- **Drinks of choice** (beer, cocktails, or mocktails for the sober curious)
- **A phone or notepad** for keeping score
- **Custom dare challenges** or use [Drinking Dojo's custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) for extra spice

## How To Play Esc

1. **Set Up the Game**
   - Everyone sits in a circle.
   - Decide the order of play (clockwise works best).

2. **Start the Challenge**
   - The first player picks a dare challenge, asks a juicy question, or starts a drinking challenge. Think “truth or dare” but with more meme energy.
   - The challenge can be anything: perform your best Fortnite dance, share an embarrassing story, or try a NSFW dare.

3. **The Power of Esc**
   - If a player doesn’t want to complete the challenge, they can call out “esc!”  
   - Here’s the catch: escaping means you drink. The group decides the penalty sip (usually 2-3 big gulps), but you can up the ante for viral drinking games or special events (like a wedding party game or election day drinking game).

4. **Keep It Moving**
   - After the “esc” penalty, the next player takes their turn.
   - Try adding a twist: if someone escapes three times, they must complete a super dare or finish their drink.

## House Rules and Variations

- **Couples Drinking Games:** Play in pairs and let your partner decide your dare or penalty.
- **Wedding Party Games:** Add custom wedding-themed challenges for the bride and groom.
- **Meme Drinking Games:** Drop in viral internet challenges or TikTok trends for extra laughs.
- **Fortnite Drinking Game Variant:** Add a rule where you must do a Fortnite emote if you “esc.”

## Pro Tips for Esc

- Keep dare challenges fun and safe — nobody wants to cross the line.
- Use Drinking Dojo’s custom drinking game builder to personalize your pack for any occasion.
- Perfect for house party ideas, birthdays, or even inauguration day drinking game sessions.
