If you’ve ever found yourself at a party during the awkward in-between — when the keg’s almost tapped but no one’s ready to call it, or everyone’s waiting for a late-night food delivery — you know the vibe can go from “lit” to “lame” fast. But what if those moments could become the wildest memories of the night? Welcome to the dojo of drinking games, where closing and delays are just new excuses to get the party started. Whether you’re at a house party, wedding afterparty, or chilling with a small crew, these party drinking games will turn any lag into legendary fun.

## Why Closing and Delays Make Epic Drinking Challenges

Let’s be real: the best party stories usually don’t happen at the peak of the night — they’re born in the weird, random moments between. Whether you’re waiting for the pizza guy during election day drinking games, or you’re stalling until everyone’s ready to hit the club, there’s always room for one more round. That’s where drinking challenges and dare challenges come in clutch.

## Top Drinking Games for When the Night Should Be Over (But Isn’t)

### 1. **Last Call Legends**

**What You Need:**  
- A deck of cards  
- Drinks for everyone

**How To Play:**  
- Everyone draws a card.  
- Lowest card? You’re the Legend—everyone else gives you a wild dare challenge (bonus points for NSFW dares if the crew’s up for it).  
- Complete the dare, or take two sips.  
- Keep drawing until the bar closes, the Uber arrives, or the food finally shows up.

### 2. **The Waiting Game**

**Perfect for:** That weird lull before a wedding party winds down, or when your Fortnite squad is waiting for the next round.

**What You Need:**  
- Timer app on your phone  
- Drinks  
- List of meme drinking games or custom dares (the wilder, the better)

**How To Play:**  
- Set a timer for 5 minutes.  
- Every time someone says “How much longer?” or checks their phone, they draw a dare from the list.  
- Not into the dare? Take a shot.  
- Keep going until the timer’s up or the next move is ready.

### 3. **Delayed Reaction**

**For:** Couples drinking games, house party ideas, or any group ready to laugh.

**What You Need:**  
- Your phone  
- A playlist of viral TikToks or memes  
- Drinks

**How To Play:**  
- Play a viral video.  
- If anyone laughs within three seconds, they drink.  
- If everyone stays stone-faced, the person who played the video does a dare challenge.  
- Add a twist: work in local faves, like a Denmark meme or Aussie classic.
