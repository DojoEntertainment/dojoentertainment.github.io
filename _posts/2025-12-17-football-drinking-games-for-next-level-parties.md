When it’s football season, it’s not just the touchdowns that get your heart racing—it’s the epic party vibes, wild dares, and the kind of drinking games that turn every match into an unforgettable event. Whether you’re watching the big game with your mates in the UK, tailgating in the US, or having a late-night footy sesh in Australia, football and party drinking games are a winning combo.

Ready to kick your next football hangout up a notch? Grab your favorite drinks, rally your squad, and check out these viral drinking games and dare challenges designed for true party legends.  

## What You’ll Need for the Best Football Drinking Games

- Drinks (beer, cider, cocktails, whatever you fancy)
- TV or stream for the match  
- Solo cups or glasses  
- Scoreboard (optional, but fun)  
- Dare cards or phone app for meme drinking games  
- Good vibes and a competitive spirit  

## 1. **Touchdown Toasts**

**How to Play:**  
Every time a team scores a touchdown (or goal, if you’re in a football/soccer mood), everyone raises their glass and takes a big sip. But wait—before you drink, the last person to stand up has to pull a dare from the NSFW dares deck or do a meme-worthy challenge (think, best victory dance or worst commentator impression).

**Rules:**  
- Touchdown? Everyone drinks.
- Last one standing? Draw a dare.
- Miss a dare? Take two extra sips.

**Pro Tip:** Make it even wilder by customizing dares with our [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com).

## 2. **Flag On The Play Drinking Challenge**

This drinking challenge is all about the penalties. Anytime there’s a flag or foul, everyone has to guess what the penalty will be. Whoever gets it wrong has to chug. If you’re playing with a big group, get creative with dares for wrong guesses—perfect for those looking for wedding party games or house party ideas with a twist.

**How to Play:**  
- Ref throws a flag? Shout your guess for the call.
- Wrong guess? Drink and do a dare challenge.
- Right guess? You’re safe (or make someone else drink).

## 3. **Halftime Meme Break Viral Drinking Game**

At halftime, it’s time for a viral drinking game. Pull up the best football memes or create your own. Everyone votes for the funniest one. The loser? They have to take a shot and do an embarrassing dare—maybe even send a cringey football pun to the group chat.

**How to Play:**  
- Share memes for laughs.
- Loser drinks and faces a dare.
- Winner gets bragging rights until the next game.

## 4. **Couples Kickoff Drinking Games**

For couples drinking games with a sporty twist, every time a player on your favorite team scores, you and your partner toast together. If your team concedes, you both take a sip, and the loser of a quick rock-paper-scissors faces a dare.
