## Why Drinking Games and Cricket Are a Match Made in Party Heaven

Cricket fans know: ind vs sa is never just a match. It’s an experience. But if you add custom drinking game builder magic and some dare challenges, you’re in for an unforgettable night, whether you’re in the US, UK, Canada, Australia, or Denmark.

## What You’ll Need

- A TV or stream of the ind vs sa match
- Scorecards or our [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) for extra spice
- Dare slips (bonus for NSFW dares or meme dares)
- Optional: Drinking Dojo meme or viral drinking games packs

## How to Play the Ind vs Sa Drinking Game

Here’s how to turn every ball, wicket, and six into a party highlight.

### Basic Rules

1. **Choose Your Players:** Split into two teams—Team Ind and Team Sa. Supporters of each side must drink based on their team’s performance.
2. **Set Your Drinks:** Decide what you’re drinking and pour up!
3. **Pick Dare Challenges:** Write down dares (fun, NSFW, or meme-inspired) and toss them in a bowl. If a team loses a challenge, they pick a dare.

### Drinking Triggers

- **Boundary (Four or Six):** Everyone on the fielding team takes a sip.
- **Wicket Falls:** Supporters of the batting team finish their drink—or pull a dare.
- **Maiden Over:** Everyone drinks, except the bowler’s fans.
- **Commentator Says “Pressure”:** Last person to raise their glass does a dare.
- **Dropped Catch:** Team that dropped the catch takes two sips.
- **Big Appeal (Whether Out or Not):** Everyone takes a gulp.
- **Super Over:** Everyone finishes their drink and does a group dare.

### Bonus: Custom Builder Power-Ups

Get creative with our custom drinking game builder! Add your own rules, meme challenges, or even mix in a Fortnite drinking game or wedding party games twist if you’re feeling wild.

## Pro Tips for Next-Level Fun

- Mix in viral drinking games between innings for non-stop action.
- Try couples drinking games if you’re watching with your partner—loser does a dare or gives a compliment.
- Use house party ideas from Drinking Dojo for themed snacks and playlist inspo.
- Want to get wild? Throw in NSFW dares for the brave (and legal-aged).
