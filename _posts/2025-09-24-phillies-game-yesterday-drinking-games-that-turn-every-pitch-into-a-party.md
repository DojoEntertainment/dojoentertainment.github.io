If you’re looking for wild, unforgettable ways to turn every strike, homer, and meme-worthy moment into a dare challenge, you’re in the right dojo.

We’re breaking down the ultimate party drinking games to play during any Phillies showdown, plus how to build your own custom drinking game for the next big match—so every inning is packed with epic dares and viral-level laughs.

## Why Turn Phillies Games Into Drinking Games?

## Phillies Game Drinking Game Rules

### What You’ll Need

- Your favorite drinks (beer, seltzer, cocktails—dealer’s choice)
- Printed rules or a mobile device
- A Phillies game on TV or stream
- Some friends (the more, the rowdier!)
- Optional: Drinking Dojo’s [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) for extra madness

### How To Play

1. **Pick Your Players:** 
    - Gather your crew. Works great with 3–10 players.
2. **Assign Roles:** 
    - Choose a “Umpire” to keep track of the rules (and call out anyone slacking).
3. **Set Up Your Drinks:** 
    - Everyone grabs their drink of choice.
4. **Game On:** 
    - Follow the rules below during the game. Take sips, gulps, or dare challenges based on what happens on the field.
