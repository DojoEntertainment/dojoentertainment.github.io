If you’ve been scrolling TikTok or group chats lately, you’ve probably spotted the viral buzz around “nyt connections hints june 22.” But what if we told you that you could turn this brain-bending trend into an epic party drinking game? Welcome to Drinking Dojo, where we remix everything from meme drinking games to dare challenges. Let’s show you how to level up your next house party or pregame with a connections-inspired drinking challenge that’s as wild as your crew.

## What’s the Nyt Connections Vibe?

Nyt Connections has taken over as the go-to word puzzle for squad bragging rights. It’s simple: you’re given a grid of words, and you have to group them into four sets based on connections. Sounds easy, right? Well, after a couple of drinks, things get seriously spicy.

## How to Turn Nyt Connections Hints June 22 into a Party Drinking Game

Ready to transform those hints into the ultimate party drinking game? Here’s how to bring the mayhem to your next hangout.

### What You’ll Need

- **A device** (phone, tablet, or laptop) to access the nyt connections hints june 22 puzzle (or [make your own custom grid](https://drinkingdojo.com)!)
- **Plenty of drinks** (beer, seltzer, cocktails, or whatever your party’s poison)
- **Scorecards** or scraps of paper for tracking points
- **A lively crew** (2–8 players is perfect)

### The Rules

1. **Set Up the Grid**
   - Pull up the nyt connections hints june 22 puzzle or use our custom drinking game builder to create your own word grid.

2. **Split Into Teams or Play Solo**
   - Teams keep it competitive, but solo works for smaller gatherings or chill nights in.

3. **Guess the Connections**
   - Each round, one team (or player) picks four words they think are connected.
   - Make the guess out loud and lock it in.

4. **Drink for Mistakes**
   - **Correct group?** Everyone else takes a sip.
   - **Wrong group?** Your team takes a drink.
   - **Epic fail (no connection)?** Take a dare challenge from the Drinking Dojo pack—think NSFW dares or wedding party games, depending on your vibe.

5. **Bonus Meme Rounds**
   - Add a meme drinking games twist: If a connection is a meme or viral moment, the fastest team to shout out the reference gives out two drinks.

6. **Keep Score**
   - Each correct set = 1 point.
   - First to four points wins and gets to hand out a shot to any player.

### Pro Tips for Maximum Mayhem

- Use the custom drinking game builder to theme your grid around inside jokes, pop culture, or wild dares.
- For a Fortnite crew, throw in some fortnite drinking game references.
- Celebrating a big event? Try an inauguration day drinking game or election day drinking game twist.
- Couples in the mix? Adapt it with spicy couples drinking games challenges.
