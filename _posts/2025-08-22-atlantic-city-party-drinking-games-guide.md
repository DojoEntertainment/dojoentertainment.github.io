## Why Atlantic City Is the Perfect Spot for Party Drinking Games

Atlantic City brings together the best vibes from the US, UK, Canada, Australia, and Denmark—think wild nights, big laughs, and memories that stick. The city’s energy makes it the ideal backdrop for trying out new and classic party drinking games.

## Top Atlantic City Drinking Games To Try

### 1. Boardwalk Roulette

**Materials Needed:**  
- Deck of cards  
- Drink of choice  
- Poker chips (optional, but on theme!)

**How To Play:**  
1. Everyone sits in a circle with their drink.  
2. Shuffle the deck and place it in the center.  
3. One by one, players draw a card:  
   - **Red card:** Take a drink.  
   - **Black card:** Give a drink to someone else.  
   - **Face card:** Dare challenge (the group picks a dare—bonus points for NSFW dares).  
   - **Joker:** Everyone chugs!

Pro Tip: Use the [Drinking Dojo custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) to add wild Atlantic City-themed dares or meme drinking games to this classic.

### 2. Atlantic City Slots

**Materials Needed:**  
- Three dice  
- Drinks  
- A notepad to keep track of wins

**How To Play:**  
1. Each player takes turns rolling all three dice.  
2. If you roll triples (three of a kind), everyone else drinks.  
3. If you roll doubles, pick someone to do a dare challenge.  
4. Roll a straight (1-2-3, 4-5-6, etc.), and you get to make a new rule for the group.

This viral drinking game is perfect for big groups and keeps the party unpredictable.

### 3. Casino Crawl

**Materials Needed:**  
- Map of Atlantic City casinos or local bars  
- Drinks (to-go cups if you’re moving around)

1. Pick 3–5 casino stops or bars for your crawl.  
2. At each stop, everyone draws a dare card or meme drinking game challenge.  
3. Complete the challenge or take a drink!  
4. Bonus: The last person standing at the end of the crawl gets a prize—or full bragging rights.
