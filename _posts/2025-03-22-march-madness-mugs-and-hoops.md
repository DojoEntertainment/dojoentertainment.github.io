As the excitement of March Madness sweeps across the nation, fans of men's NCAA basketball are gearing up for thrilling games, buzzer-beaters, and Cinderella stories. But why not take your game-watching experience to the next level with a spirited drinking game? Designed especially for college basketball enthusiasts, this game combines the thrill of the tournament with some light-hearted fun. So grab your favorite drinks, your best friends, and prepare to cheer, sip, and score!

### Game Setup

#### Materials Needed:
- A television or streaming device to watch the games
- Beverages of your choice (alcoholic or non-alcoholic)
- Game score sheets or a whiteboard
- A coin for flipping
- Optional: Team jerseys or fan gear for added spirit

### How to Play

#### Basic Rules:
1. **Coin Toss**: Before the game starts, flip a coin to decide which team each participant will support. Heads for the higher-seeded team, tails for the lower-seeded team.

2. **Tip-Off Toast**: As the game begins with the tip-off, everyone raises their glass and takes a ceremonial sip to kick off the festivities.

3. **Scoring Sips**:
   - **Two-point Field Goal**: Take a small sip.
   - **Three-point Shot**: Take a larger sip.
   - **Free Throw**: Take a sip if it's made; otherwise, cheer for the attempt!

4. **Fouls and Freebies**:
   - **Personal Foul**: If your team commits a foul, take a sip.
   - **Technical Foul**: Everyone takes a sip, regardless of their team.

5. **Turnover Trouble**: Each time your team turns the ball over, take a sip and shout "Defense!"

6. **Half-Time Halftime**: During halftime, participants can either discuss game strategies or take a short break to refresh their beverages.

7. **Final Five**: As the last five minutes approach, anticipation builds. Each made basket results in double sips to match the intensity of the game.

8. **Buzzer Beater**: If a game-winning shot is made at the buzzer, everyone finishes their drink in celebration or consolation.

#### Optional Bonus:
- **Upset Alert**: If the lower-seeded team wins, everyone supporting the higher-seeded team takes a victory sip in honor of the underdog.

### Safety and Fun First

Remember, the goal is to enjoy the game and the camaraderie, so drink responsibly and know your limits. You can always substitute alcoholic drinks with non-alcoholic options to ensure everyone can participate and have fun. Be sure to have plenty of snacks and water available to keep everyone hydrated and happy.
