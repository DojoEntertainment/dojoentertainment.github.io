Are you ready to take your Notre Dame football fandom to the next level? Whether you're tailgating, hosting a watch party, or just chilling with friends on game day, the Notre Dame Football Drinking Game is the perfect way to add some fun and excitement to the experience. Let's dive into the rules, how to play, and what you'll need to get started.

## Game Rules

The rules are simple and designed to keep the energy high and spirits even higher. Here's how you play

1. **Touchdown Toast**: Every time Notre Dame scores a touchdown, everyone raises their glass and takes a celebratory drink.
2. **Penalty Pour**: If Notre Dame gets a penalty, everyone must take a sip for each yard penalized. If it's a 15-yard penalty, that's 15 sips. Be careful with this one
3. **Interception Imbibe**: When Notre Dame intercepts the ball, everyone takes a big gulp. If it's a pick-six, double it up
4. **Field Goal Cheers**: A successful field goal means everyone clinks glasses and takes a drink.
5. **Quarterback's Quest**: Every time the quarterback gets sacked, take a sip for every yard lost.
6. **Coach's Challenge**: If the coach challenges a play and wins, everyone else drinks. If the coach loses the challenge, the person who called the play drinks.
7. **Victory Celebration**: If Notre Dame wins the game, everyone finishes their drink and celebrates the victory
