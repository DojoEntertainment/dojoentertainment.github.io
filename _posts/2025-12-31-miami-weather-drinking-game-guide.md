When the forecast says Miami weather, you know it’s going to be unpredictable, steamy, and maybe a little bit wild—just like the best party drinking games. Whether you’re sweating it out on a rooftop, cooling off by the pool, or hosting a wild house party, it’s only right to bring some Miami-inspired energy to your next drinking night. Ready to ride the storm? We’ve cooked up the ultimate Miami Weather Drinking Game, complete with dare challenges, meme drinking games, and enough twists to keep everyone guessing.

## What You Need

- Your favorite drinks (cocktails, beer, seltzers—whatever screams Miami to you)
- A deck of cards or a smartphone for prompts
- A speaker for those essential Miami beats
- At least 3 friends (the more, the messier)
- Optional: Sunglasses, beach towels, and a fan for dramatic effect

## How To Play Miami Weather Drinking Game

### Game Setup

1. **Set the Mood:** Crank up a Miami party playlist and set out your drinks—bonus points if you bring out tropical cocktails.
2. **Create Your Deck:** Use a regular deck of cards, or, for ultimate chaos, build your own using the [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) from Drinking Dojo.
3. **Assign Roles:** Nominate a Weather Reporter (the person who reads out the cards/prompts) and a Lifeguard (who makes sure everyone hydrates and keeps it safe).

### Rules

Every card or prompt relates to Miami weather—think sudden rain, heatwaves, hurricanes, or beach vibes. Here’s how it breaks down:

- **Sunny:** Everyone raises a toast and takes a sip. If you’re wearing sunglasses, skip your drink and nominate someone else.
- **Thunderstorm:** The Weather Reporter shouts “Thunder!” and everyone must clap once. The last to clap drinks and has to do a dare from the meme drinking games list.
- **Heatwave:** All players fan themselves. The first to stop fanning drinks twice.
- **Rainstorm:** Everyone huddles together (as much as possible). Whoever’s left out of the group drinks.
- **Hurricane:** All drinks must be finished (or chugged), and the next round is double dares.
- **Beach Party:** Play a viral drinking game for one round—think flip cup, beer pong, or a quick Fortnite drinking game challenge.

### Dare Challenges

Mix in some classic Miami-inspired dares:

- Try to salsa dance for 30 seconds—if you fail, take a shot.
- Recite your best Miami Vice line. If no one laughs, drink.
- Make a toast using only weather metaphors.
- For the brave, add an NSFW dare if you’re playing in a 21+ crowd (think: “Text your crush a weather emoji,” or “Do your best weather forecast in your swimsuit”).
