When it comes to unforgettable nights, nobody does it quite like millennials. From legendary house parties to low-key hangouts, millennials have turned drinking games into an art form. At Drinking Dojo, we know that meme drinking games, viral challenges, and custom dares are the secret sauce for parties that people actually remember. Whether youâ€™re in a cozy flat in London, a backyard in Sydney, a Toronto apartment, or a Copenhagen courtyard, these party drinking games are your ticket to epic memories.

## Why Millennials Love Drinking Games

Letâ€™s face itâ€”millennials know how to mix nostalgia, competition, and pure chaos. Drinking games arenâ€™t just about the drinks; theyâ€™re about connection, meme-worthy moments, and wild dare challenges. With everything from classic card games to custom drinking game builders, millennials are making the rules (and sometimes breaking them).

## Three Drinking Games Millennials Canâ€™t Get Enough Of

### 1. Meme Mayhem

**What you need:**  
- A deck of meme cards (or print your own from Drinking Dojoâ€™s custom drinking game builder!)  
- Drinks for everyone

**How to play:**  
1. Shuffle the meme cards and place them in the center.  
2. On your turn, draw a card and read the meme/statement aloud.  
3. If the meme applies to you, take a sip.  
4. If itâ€™s a perfect fit, share the story behind it for an extra dare challenge (suggested by the group!).  
5. First to hit five sips in a round gets to make a new ruleâ€”millennial house rules style.

**Why it works:**  
Meme drinking games bring out the best stories and the hardest laughs. Plus, the custom factor means every pack is as unique as your crew.

### 2. NSFW Dare Roulette

**What you need:**  
- A bowl of NSFW dares (check out Drinking Dojo for inspiration)  
- Smartphone for timer  
- Drinks, obviously

**How to play:**  
1. Each player writes three spicy dares and places them in the bowl.  
2. On your turn, draw a dare and decideâ€”do it, or drink!  
3. If you do the dare in under 30 seconds, you assign drinks to anyone you choose.  
4. Back out? You drink double.

**Why it works:**  
Millennials arenâ€™t afraid to push boundaries, and this game serves up both laughter and iconic stories for years to come.

### 3. Fortnite Drinking Game

**What you need:**  
- Fortnite (or another favorite video game)  
- Drinks for all players  
- Printed rules (customize with our builder)

**How to play:**  
1. Everyone picks a character and pours their drink.  
2. Whenever you get eliminated, take a sip.  
3. Win a round? Assign five sips to any player.  
4. Complete a wild trick or meme-worthy move? Everyone else drinks.

**Why it works:**  
Gaming meets drinking games meets meme culture. Nothing says millennial like battling it out online with a drink in hand.

## Pro Tips to Level Up Your Party Drinking Games

- **Customize with Dare Challenges:** Use a custom drinking game builder to mix in inside jokes, local references from the US, UK, Canada, Australia, or Denmark, and wild dares.  
- **Mix Up the Packs:** Rotate between meme drinking games, viral drinking games, and classic challenges to keep the energy high.  
- **Theme the Night:** Try an inauguration day drinking game, wedding party games, or even a couples drinking game to fit the occasion.
