## How to Play the Resultat Eurovision 2025 Drinking Game

Ready to make Eurovision even more unforgettable? Here’s what you’ll need and how to play:

### What You’ll Need

- Your drink(s) of choice (beer, cocktails, mocktails—no judgment)
- A TV, laptop, or phone streaming the Eurovision 2025 finale
- Printed or digital Eurovision bingo cards (optional, but fun)
- Dare challenge cards or access to our [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) for bonus chaos
- Friends who are ready to sing, dance, and maybe embarrass themselves—just a little

### The Rules

**1. Take a Sip When:**
- A country gives itself the maximum points
- Someone mentions “resultat eurovision 2025” or says “douze points”
- The host tries (and fails) to make a joke land
- There’s a costume change mid-performance

**2. Two Sips For:**
- A song that sounds suspiciously like a previous Eurovision hit
- Any mention of political voting
- A meme-worthy moment you know will go viral

**3. Finish Your Drink If:**
- Your country wins (or loses spectacularly)
- Someone pulls out a prop that makes zero sense
- The voting results get booed by the crowd

**4. Dare Challenges (Optional Bonus Round):**
- NSFW dares: Loser of each round picks a dare from the pile—keep it friendly, but push the limits
- Meme drinking games: Assign a meme to each country and drink whenever it pops up on social media

**5. Couples Drinking Games Twist:**
- Partner up and take turns guessing the winner of each heat—wrong guesses mean you both drink!
