Ever wanted to fling a dapper pig at your friends and watch the barnyard explode into chaos? **[Ham to Ham Combat](https://hamtohamcombat.com/)** is the one‑button, physics‑based party brawler that lets up to four players settle their porky grudges in style. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## Why it’s instantly addictive

- **Single‑button controls** – anyone on the couch can jump straight in, but mastering momentum, timing and the occasional top‑hat twirl takes practice. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- **Physics‑based mayhem** – every shove, bounce and belly‑flop is driven by gloriously unpredictable ragdoll physics, so you’ll laugh as often as you win. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- **Dynamic, destructible arenas** – fences splinter, crates fly and the scenery quickly turns into a hazardous playground. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

## Pick your Ham Warrior

Choose the hat that best expresses your inner hog, then charge, bump and bash until you’re the last ham standing. Quick rounds keep the energy high and friendships… tenuous.
