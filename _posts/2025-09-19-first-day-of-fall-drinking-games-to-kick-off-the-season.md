The leaves might be changing, but party drinking games are forever. As the first day of fall rolls in—bringing sweater weather, bonfire nights, and pumpkin-spiced everything—it’s time to swap summer seltzers for cozy, unforgettable drinking challenges with your crew. Whether you’re chilling in a dorm room, hosting friends in your flat, or planning an epic house party, there’s no better way to toast the season than with meme drinking games, daring dares, and some seriously viral drinking games.

## Why Fall Parties Hit Different

Let’s be honest: fall parties just have that vibe. It’s the season for wild stories, fresh starts, and making memories before winter hibernation. And nothing says “legendary night” like a stack of custom drinking game cards and a crew ready for anything. Drinking Dojo’s got your back with party drinking games that’ll have everyone talking 'til next fall.

## Essential Drinking Game Packs for Fall Nights

### 1. **Pumpkin Spice and Everything Dice**

**What you need:**  
- A set of dice  
- A drink for each player  
- A sense of adventure

**How to play:**  
1. Everyone circles up, dice in hand.  
2. Players take turns rolling.  
   - Roll a 1 or 2: Give a drink to anyone.  
   - Roll a 3 or 4: Take a sip yourself.  
   - Roll a 5: Dare time! The roller picks a dare from the group (bonus if you use NSFW dares for a spicy twist).  
   - Roll a 6: Create a new rule that everyone has to follow for the next round.

**Pro tip:** Make it a meme drinking game by adding a “viral challenge” for every double roll (think TikTok dances or funny impressions).

### 2. **Bonfire Dare Challenges**

**What you need:**  
- A stack of dare cards (homemade, or use [Drinking Dojo’s custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com))  
- Drinks of choice

**How to play:**  
1. Everyone grabs a card and reads their dare aloud.  
2. Complete the dare or take a drink—no backing down.  
3. Keep it rolling until everyone’s had a go or the bonfire goes out.

**Dare ideas:**  
- “Sing the chorus of your favorite fall song”  
- “Swap seats with someone every time the wind blows”  
- “Call out the best dressed in the group—loser drinks!”

### 3. **Sweater Weather Sip-Off**

**What you need:**  
- Drinks (hot toddies, cider, or your autumn favorite)  
- A playlist of fall bangers

**How to play:**  
1. Everyone takes a drink every time:  
   - Someone mentions being cold  
   - A song with “fall” in the lyrics plays  
   - Someone posts a party pic to social media

Kick it up a notch by adding a dare challenge for every third drink!
