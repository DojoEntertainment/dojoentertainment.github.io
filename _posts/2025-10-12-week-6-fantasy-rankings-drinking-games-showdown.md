Whether you’re chilling with your mates, gearing up for an election day drinking game, or just need some custom party drinking games, this fantasy-inspired showdown is your ticket to unforgettable fun.

## What You’ll Need

- Your week 6 fantasy rankings (printed, on your phone, or up on the TV—whatever works)
- Drinks of choice (go classic, or mix up your own signature cocktail)
- Dare deck or custom drinking game builder from [Drinking Dojo](https://drinkingdojo.com)
- A crew who’s ready for drinking challenges and plenty of trash talk

## How to Play: Fantasy Rankings Drinking Game

### Step 1: Set Up Your Squads
- **Pick Teams:** Everyone picks a fantasy squad from the official week 6 fantasy rankings. Play solo or in pairs, depending on your group size.
- **Name Your Team:** Bonus sip for funniest team name—crowd decides!

### Step 2: Draft Your Drinking Rules
Here’s where the real party starts. Assign a drinking action for key fantasy events. Use these base rules or build your own with the custom drinking game builder:

- **Touchdown:** If your player scores, hand out a drink.
- **Interception:** If your player throws or receives an interception, you drink.
- **Fumble:** Player fumbles? That’s a dare challenge—pull a card from the dare deck.
- **Big Yardage:** Any play over 25 yards? Everyone drinks.
- **Bench Burner:** If a benched player outscores a starter, team captain does a meme drinking game (think: recite a meme in their best impression, or finish their drink if they fail).

*Want to keep it spicy? Mix in some NSFW dares if it’s that kind of party.*

### Step 3: Viral Drinking Games Twist
- **Underdog Upset:** If your lowest-ranked player outperforms a top pick, everyone else takes two drinks.
- **Fantasy Flop:** If your highest pick scores below 5 points, it’s time for a group dare challenge—let the Drinking Dojo app pick something wild.

### Step 4: Keep Score, But Don’t Sweat It
- At the end of the game, the squad with the highest fantasy points chooses a losing team to complete a final dare.
- Take pics, share memes, and make it go viral—bonus points for the best party highlight shared to your group chat.
