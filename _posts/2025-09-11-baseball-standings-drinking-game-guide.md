Ready to rank your crew and see who comes out on top at your next party? It’s time to bring the heat with the Baseball Standings Drinking Game—a wild twist on party drinking games that’ll have everyone swinging for the fences. Whether you’re chilling in a dorm room, throwing a house party, or looking for wedding party games with a viral drinking game vibe, this is your ticket to a night full of laughs, dares, and unforgettable memories.

### What You Need

- **A deck of cards** (or use Drinking Dojo’s [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) to make it spicy)  
- **Plastic cups** (at least four per team)  
- **Ping pong ball**  
- **Your drink of choice**  
- **A table and a crew of 4–12 players** (split into two teams)  

### How To Play Baseball Standings Drinking Game

This party drinking game is inspired by a classic, but we’re taking it to the next level with dare challenges, meme drinking games energy, and a standings system to crown the ultimate champions. Here’s how to get started:

#### Setup

1. **Arrange the Cups:**  
   Place four cups in a straight line on each side of the table (like bases on a baseball field). Fill each cup with your chosen drink.  
2. **Split Into Teams:**  
   Divide into two teams (equal numbers or as close as you can).  
3. **Determine Batting Order:**  
   Flip a coin or play a quick round of NSFW dares to see who bats first.  

#### Gameplay

- **Batting Team:**  
  The batting team tries to toss a ping pong ball into the opposing team’s cups. Each cup represents a base (single, double, triple, home run).  
    - Land the ball in the first cup = Single  
    - Second cup = Double  
    - Third cup = Triple  
    - Fourth cup = Home Run  

- **Advancing Runners:**  
  Whenever a player lands a shot, that team gets a runner on base. Keep track using coins, bottle caps, or whatever’s handy.  

- **Drinking Rules:**  
  For every cup hit, the fielding team drinks the contents of that cup. On a home run, everyone on the fielding team drinks!  

- **Outs:**  
  If you miss all four cups, that’s an out. Three outs and the teams switch sides.  

- **Standings:**  
  After nine “innings” (team turns), count your runs. The team with the most runs tops the baseball standings, earning bragging rights—or dare challenges delivered by the losers.  

### Dare Challenges and Viral Twists
