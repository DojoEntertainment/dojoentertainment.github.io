Looking for a new twist on your usual party drinking games? If you’ve been obsessing over the latest viral word puzzles, we’ve got a wild mashup just for you. Introducing the Nyt Connections Hints September 4 Drinking Game — where wordplay meets epic dare challenges, meme drinking games, and unforgettable memories. Whether you’re vibing with friends in a dorm room, planning some wedding party games, or just want a hilarious night in, this one’s for you.

## What Is the Nyt Connections Hints September 4 Drinking Game?

It’s simple: combine the brain-twisting fun of popular connections puzzles with the thrill of classic drinking games. Players work together (or against each other) to solve word groupings, but each round comes with a drinking twist — think NSFW dares, meme-worthy forfeits, and custom challenges. 

## What You’ll Need

- **A group of friends** (2–8 players is perfect)
- **A device** (phone, tablet, or laptop) to access the puzzle
- **Drinks of choice** (cocktails, beer, mocktails — whatever works!)
- **Paper and pens** (optional, for tracking scores or dares)
- **Dare cards or your favorite Drinking Dojo game pack** (for extra chaos)

## How to Play

### 1. Set Up the Puzzle
- Open the latest connections puzzle (like the one from September 4) on your chosen device.
- Make sure everyone can see the puzzle or read out the words for the group.

### 2. Team Up or Go Solo
- Divide into teams or play every person for themselves.

### 3. Guess the Connection
- Take turns picking four words you think are connected.
- If you’re right, **cheers!** Everyone else drinks.
- If you’re wrong, **spin the dare wheel** (or draw a Dare card from your Drinking Dojo pack) and complete the challenge.

### 4. Add Some Drinking Challenges
- For every wrong guess, the player or team must either take a sip or complete a meme drinking game dare.
- If someone guesses a connection that’s way off, they must do an NSFW dare or answer a spicy question from the group.

### 5. Level Up the Fun
- The player who solves the FINAL group gets to make a custom rule for the next round.
- Bonus: Incorporate viral themes like a “Fortnite drinking game” rule (e.g., do a Fortnite dance if you get a connection wrong) or add election day drinking game trivia for extra laughs.

### 6. Keep It Going
- Mix and match with other party drinking games or use the [Drinking Dojo custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) to create your own wild rules and dares.

## Pro Tips for an Epic Night
