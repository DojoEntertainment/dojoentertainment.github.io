When MLB trade rumors start swirling, it’s not just the players getting shuffled—your party lineup is about to get an upgrade too. Whether you’re a die-hard baseball fan or just love an excuse to mix up your house party ideas, this is the ultimate way to hit a home run with your crew. Welcome to the MLB Trade Rumors Drinking Game, brought to you by the meme drinking games experts at Drinking Dojo.

Ready to spark viral drinking game chaos while you track every wild trade update? Let’s play ball.

### What You’ll Need

- Your favorite drinks (beer, seltzer, cocktails—dealer’s choice)  
- A TV, laptop, or phone to follow MLB trade rumors in real time (socials, ESPN, Reddit, whatever’s trending)  
- A group of at least 3 players (more = more chaos)  
- Dare cards (optional: print some wild NSFW dares or use the [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) for a personalized pack)  
- Score sheet or whiteboard (optional, for keeping track)  

### How To Play MLB Trade Rumors Drinking Game

**Step 1: Set Up Your Party Dugout**  
Gather your starting lineup and get your drinks ready. Each player chooses a team or a favorite player on the trade block.

**Step 2: Assign Drinking Prompts**  
Here are your core rules. Take a sip, a gulp, or a dare challenge whenever the following happen:

- **Rumor Drops**: Every time a new trade rumor pops up, everyone drinks.  
- **False Alarm**: If a rumor gets debunked or denied, last person to react does a dare.  
- **Big Name Traded**: If a star player gets traded, everyone finishes their drink or completes a viral drinking game challenge.  
- **Your Team in the Rumor**: If your chosen team is mentioned in a rumor, you drink.  
- **Unexpected Move**: If a player is traded somewhere wild (looking at you, Denmark), everyone must try to name an MLB team from that country. Fail? Drink.  
- **Meme Moment**: If a meme-worthy trade or reaction hits Twitter or Reddit, vote for the best meme in the group. Loser drinks.  

**Step 3: Dare Challenges and NSFW Dares**  
Want to crank it up? Whenever someone says, “That’ll never happen,” they draw a dare card. Use custom dares, or grab a spicy pack from Drinking Dojo to keep things wild.

**Step 4: Special Inning – Trade Prediction**  
Before the party starts, everyone writes down a trade prediction. If yours comes true, assign a drinking challenge to anyone in the group. If no one wins, all must do a group dare.
