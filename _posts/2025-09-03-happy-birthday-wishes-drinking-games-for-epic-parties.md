Birthdays are about more than cake and awkward singing—they’re a perfect excuse to round up your crew and kick the party into high gear with drinking games that turn “happy birthday wishes” into full-on legendary memories. Whether you’re chilling in a dorm, booking out an Airbnb, or dancing under a disco ball at a wedding afterparty, Drinking Dojo has the party drinking games and dare challenges to make every birthday one for the books.

## Why Birthday Drinking Games Are the Ultimate Party Hack

Let’s be real: birthday celebrations are the best excuse for a little mayhem. Adding viral drinking games or meme drinking games to the mix brings everyone together, breaks the ice, and guarantees unforgettable “remember when” moments. Plus, with custom drinking game builders and wild NSFW dares, you can shape the night exactly how your squad likes it.

## Top Happy Birthday Wishes Drinking Games

Ready to level up your next birthday bash? Here are our favorite drinking games perfect for bringing birthday wishes to life:

### 1. **Birthday Wishes Roulette**

**What You Need:**
- Notecards or slips of paper
- Pens
- Drinks (whatever your crew prefers)
- A bowl or hat

**How to Play:**
1. **Write It Down**: Each guest writes a “happy birthday wish” or dare for the birthday person on a notecard—think sweet, spicy, or totally ridiculous.
2. **Mix It Up**: Throw all the cards into a bowl.
3. **Draw and Drink**: The birthday person draws a card, reads the wish aloud, and does whatever it says. If they chicken out, they have to take a drink instead.
4. **Keep It Going**: Once the birthday person’s made it through a few rounds, let guests take turns pulling cards too.

**Pro Tip:** Add meme drinking games rules for extra laughs—like reading the wish in your best celebrity impression or while doing a Fortnite dance.

### 2. **Birthday Dare Challenges**

**What You Need:**
- Pre-made dare cards (or our [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com))
- Drinks

**How to Play:**
1. Shuffle up the dare cards.
2. Everyone sits in a circle.
3. On your turn, draw a dare. Complete it—or take a drink.
4. If the birthday person completes a dare, everyone else drinks!

**Ideas for Dares:**
- Sing your wildest “happy birthday” remix
- Post a silly meme on your story
- Give a toast in a fake accent
- Share your most embarrassing birthday story

Make it NSFW if the vibe’s right, or keep it friendly for mixed company. The best part? You can make it as wild or chill as you want.

### 3. **Sip for Every Year**

**What You Need:**
- Drinks (cocktails, shots, or mocktails)
- A list of fun or cringey moments from each year of the birthday person’s life

**How to Play:**
1. For every year, share a funny memory or milestone involving the birthday guest.
2. The birthday person takes one sip for every story—bonus points if they remember the details.
3. If they can’t recall, everyone else drinks instead!

This one’s perfect for smaller, close-knit gatherings—and it gets better (and fuzzier) as the years (and drinks) add up.

## Pro Tips to Make Birthday Drinking Games Legendary

- **Theme It Up**: Try a Fortnite drinking game or a wedding party games twist for birthdays that fall near big events.
- **Keep It Safe**: Know your limits, and always have water and snacks on hand.
- **Customize Everything**: Use Drinking Dojo’s custom drinking game builder to tailor the night to your crew’s style—think inside jokes, spicy dares, and viral memes.
