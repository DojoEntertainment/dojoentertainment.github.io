When the CPI report drops, the group chat lights up and Twitter explodes. But what if you could turn those hot takes and economic updates into the wildest party drinking game of the month? Welcome to the CPI Report Drinking Game—a blend of meme drinking games, dare challenges, and classic party drinking games that’s perfect for house parties, pregames, or even your next wedding party game night.

## What You Need

- A TV, laptop, or phone to stream the CPI report coverage or check live updates  
- Your favorite drinks (beer, seltzer, cocktails, or mocktails—dealer’s choice)  
- Dare cards or a mobile dare challenge generator (try [Drinking Dojo’s custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) for spicy twists)  
- Meme-worthy reaction faces printed or on your phone (for the meme drinking games segment)  
- A squad ready for anything

## How To Play the CPI Report Drinking Game

### 1. Set Up Your Party

- Gather your crew, pour those drinks, and get the CPI report stream or updates on a screen everyone can see.  
- Decide on your favorite meme or viral drinking games to mix in when things get slow.

### 2. Drinking Game Rules

Every time one of these events happens during the CPI report or analysis, take a drink:

- The phrase “inflation” gets mentioned  
- A host says “cost of living”  
- Someone blames supply chains  
- Charts or graphs pop up on the screen  
- There’s a wild prediction about the economy  
- The word “unexpected” is used  
- Someone compares this CPI to last year  
- A politician gets quoted

**Bonus:** If someone in your party correctly predicts a stat before it’s announced, everyone else drinks!

### 3. Dare Challenges

Spice up your CPI party by adding dare challenges between updates:

- Each time there’s an awkward silence or technical glitch, the person to first shout “Recession!” assigns a dare. (Need ideas? Use Drinking Dojo’s NSFW dares or a dare generator.)  
- If there’s a meme-worthy moment (“Did someone just fall asleep on air?”), the last person to react must do a meme dare—like recreating the face or sending a silly selfie to the group chat.

### 4. Viral Drinking Game Switch-Ups

- Add a Fortnite drinking game round if someone mentions “supply drop.”  
- If debates start about the best election day drinking game, pause for a couples drinking game round (perfect for those “power couples” who always argue about economics).  
- Turn boring commentary into a wedding party game by assigning toasts every time a guest analyst says something confusing.

- Keep it safe: Drink water, know your limits, and have snacks on hand.  
- Mix up the fun: Try the [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) to create your own CPI-themed dares or challenges.  
- Snap pics of your group’s best meme reactions and share them (tag @DrinkingDojo for some viral love).
