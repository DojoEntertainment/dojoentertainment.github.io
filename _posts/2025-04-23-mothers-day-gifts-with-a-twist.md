Mother's Day is a time to celebrate the amazing women who have supported and guided us. While traditional gifts like flowers, chocolates, and spa vouchers are always appreciated, why not add a fun twist to your Mother's Day celebration this year? Introducing a creative and entertaining activity that brings everyone together: **Mother's Day Gift Swap Drinking Game**. This game is perfect for family gatherings, adding laughter and a bit of friendly competition to your celebration.

### How to Play the Mother's Day Gift Swap Drinking Game

#### Objective
The goal of the game is to exchange gifts in a fun and interactive way, all while enjoying some drinks. It's a light-hearted way to show appreciation and create lasting memories with loved ones.

#### Materials Needed
- A selection of wrapped gifts (one per participant). This could be a mix of typical Mother's Day gifts like candles, bath bombs, or even quirky items like funny mugs.
- A set of dice.
- Beverages of your choice (alcoholic or non-alcoholic, depending on your preference).
- A timer (optional).

#### Game Setup
1. Gather all participants in a circle and place the wrapped gifts in the center.
2. Ensure each player has a drink in hand.
3. Decide on a gift budget beforehand to ensure all gifts are of similar value.

#### Rules
1. **Rolling the Dice**: Participants take turns rolling two dice. The number rolled determines the action:
   - **2 or 12**: Swap your gift with anyone.
   - **3 or 11**: Everyone takes a sip of their drink.
   - **4 or 10**: Unwrap the gift in front of you.
   - **5 or 9**: Choose someone to take a sip.
   - **6 or 8**: Re-roll the dice.
   - **7**: Keep your gift as it is.

2. **Unwrapping**: Once a gift is unwrapped, it stays visible. The next player who rolls a 4 or 10 must unwrap their gift if it's still wrapped or choose to swap with another unwrapped gift.

3. **Time Limit**: For added excitement, set a timer for 30 minutes to complete the game. Once the time is up, everyone keeps the gift they have.

4. **Ending the Game**: The game ends either when all gifts are unwrapped or when the timer goes off. Each participant ends up with a gift, and the fun memories continue!

### Tips for a Successful Game
- Personalize the gifts to add a special touch. This could be a favorite book, a homemade treat, or a gift card to a beloved restaurant.
- Make sure to include non-alcoholic drink options for those who prefer them.
- Encourage everyone to bring their sense of humor and enjoy the playful spirit of the game.
