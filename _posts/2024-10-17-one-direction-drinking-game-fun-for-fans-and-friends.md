This One Direction drinking game is easy to play, requires minimal materials, and promises loads of fun and laughter. So grab your favorite drink and let the games begin

## What You'll Need

- A group of One Direction fans (the more, the merrier)
- Your favorite beverages
- A device to play One Direction music and videos
- A list of One Direction trivia questions optional

## How to Play 

The One Direction drinking game is a mix of music appreciation, trivia, and classic drinking game rules. Here’s how to get started

### Preparation

1. **Create a Playlist**: Compile a playlist of One Direction’s greatest hits and music videos. This will be the soundtrack for the evening and a key component of the game.

2. **Set Up a Viewing Area**: Make sure everyone can see the screen where the videos will be played. This is crucial for the music video challenges.

### Game Rules

1. **Sip for a Song**: Every time a One Direction song starts, take a sip of your drink. This is a great way to get everyone in the spirit right from the start.

2. **Lyrics Challenge**: Pause the song at any random point. The first person to correctly sing the next line can choose someone to take a drink. If they get it wrong, they take a drink themselves.

3. **Trivia Time**: Ask a One Direction-related trivia question. The first person to answer correctly gets to choose another player to drink. If no one knows the answer, everyone takes a sip.

4. **Music Video Moves**: When a music video is playing, everyone must mimic the dance moves. Anyone caught not participating has to drink.

5. **Directioner Dare**: The group can challenge someone to perform a One Direction dare. Failure to complete the dare results in a drink penalty.

6. **Bonus Round**: Play a round of [Truth or Dare](https://drinkingdojo.com/games/truth-or-dare) with a One Direction twist. All questions and dares must be related to the band or their songs.

### Ending the Game

The game can go on for as long as the group desires, but it’s a good idea to decide on an endpoint at the beginning. This could be when the playlist runs out or after a certain number of rounds. Remember to always drink responsibly and know your limits.

## Conclusion

With catchy tunes, fun challenges, and a little bit of competition, it’s sure to be a hit at your next gathering.
