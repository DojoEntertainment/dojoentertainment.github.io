Ready to take your party drinking games to the next level? If you love viral drinking games, meme drinking games, and a little friendly competition, the Wordle Hint Drinking Game is your new go-to. This game mashes up puzzle-solving fun with dare challenges and classic house party vibes. Whether you’re pregaming with your crew, throwing a wedding rager, or just chilling with friends, this custom drinking game builder idea is a must-try.

## What Is The Wordle Hint Drinking Game?

Think you’re good at guessing words? Add a drink in hand, some NSFW dares (if you’re feeling bold), and a bunch of friends, and suddenly guessing gets way more interesting. The Wordle Hint Drinking Game is all about using classic Wordle-style clues, but with every wrong guess, the stakes get wilder. It’s perfect for a night in, couples drinking games, or even spicing up your next wedding party.

## What You’ll Need

- **A list of five-letter words** (you can use an app, website, or make your own)
- **Paper and pens for hints** or a phone for digital play
- **Drinks of your choice** (beer, cocktails, shots, or mocktails—no judgment here)
- **Dare cards or a dare generator** (optional, but highly recommended for extra mayhem)

## How To Play The Wordle Hint Drinking Game

1. **Choose the Host:** One person picks a secret five-letter word.
2. **Give The First Hint:** The host gives a Wordle-style hint (e.g., “One letter is in the right place!” or “Two letters are correct but in the wrong spot!”).
3. **Guessing Time:** Everyone else takes turns guessing the word.
4. **Wrong Guess? Drink Up:** For every incorrect guess, the guesser takes a drink.
5. **Dare Challenge (Optional):** If someone’s guess is way off (like, not even one letter correct), they have to draw a dare card or complete a challenge. This is where things can get meme-worthy and totally wild!
6. **Winning The Round:** Whoever guesses the word correctly gets to pick the next word or make up a custom dare for the group.

## Make It Even Wilder

- **NSFW Dares:** Add a stack of not-safe-for-work dares for those 18+ nights.
- **Theme Nights:** Try a Fortnite drinking game spin (only use Fortnite-related words) or create an inauguration day drinking game with political terms.
- **Couples Drinking Games:** Play in pairs and double the dares (and the fun).
- **Wedding Party Games:** Use the names of the bride, groom, or inside jokes for a personalized twist.
