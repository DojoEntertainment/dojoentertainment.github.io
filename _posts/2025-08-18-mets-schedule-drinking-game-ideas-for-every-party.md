Ready to turn baseball season into an epic party? Whether you’re pregaming for the Mets, hosting a house party, or just vibing with friends, a Mets schedule drinking game is the perfect way to bring the crew together for some unforgettable moments. At Drinking Dojo, we’re all about taking classic party drinking games and adding wild dare challenges, viral memes, and custom twists for the ultimate night out (or in).

Let’s break down how to turn any Mets game into a legendary drinking game experience—no matter if you’re a hardcore fan or just here for the snacks and good vibes.

## What You Need for a Mets Schedule Drinking Game Night

Before the first pitch, grab the essentials:

- **Drinks** (your choice: beer, seltzers, cocktails, or non-alcoholic if you want to keep it chill)
- **TV/streaming device** for the Mets game  
- **Printed Mets schedule** or have it pulled up on your phone
- **Custom drinking game builder** (use [Drinking Dojo’s custom tool](https://drinkingdojo.com) to add your own dares and memes)
- **Notepad or app** for tracking points or dares
- A group of friends ready for some fun

## Basic Rules for a Mets Schedule Drinking Game

Mix and match, or use our suggested rules below to keep the party going from the first inning to the last out. Customize with our meme drinking games or dare challenges for extra spice!

### Take a Sip When

- The Mets get a single or double
- The commentators mention New York
- There’s a pitching change
- The camera cuts to a wild fan in the crowd
- Someone tries to explain the rules of baseball… again

### Take Two Sips When

## Dare Challenges and Meme Drinking Game Twists

Want to level up your Mets schedule drinking game? Add some meme-worthy NSFW dares or viral drinking game challenges between innings:

- **Meme Drinking Games:** Assign a meme to each player—if that meme situation happens during the broadcast, that player drinks. (E.g., “That’s so Mets” moment, a hot dog cam, or a mascot dance-off.)
- **Custom Drinking Game Builder:** Use Drinking Dojo’s custom tool to add your own rules tailored to the Mets schedule or tonight’s lineup.
