## What Are Wild Card Standings in Drinking Games?

In the world of party drinking games, “wild card standings” means anything can happen. At any moment, someone can shoot to the top (or bottom) of the leaderboard with a lucky—or unlucky—draw. It’s unpredictable, hilarious, and guaranteed to cause mayhem among friends.

## What You Need

- A deck of standard playing cards  
- Your drink of choice (keep it fun, stay safe)  
- A scoreboard (whiteboard, phone app, or old-school pen and paper)  
- Dare challenges—either from your own imagination or a custom drinking game builder like [Drinking Dojo](https://drinkingdojo.com)  
- At least 4 players (but the more, the merrier!)  

## How to Play Wild Card Standings

### 1. Prep the Deck

- Remove the jokers and shuffle the cards.  
- Assign each suit to a different type of dare:  
  - **Hearts:** Classic drinking challenges (e.g., “waterfall,” “never have I ever”)  
  - **Diamonds:** NSFW dares (keep it spicy, but consensual)  
  - **Clubs:** Meme-inspired dares (think viral TikTok trends)  
  - **Spades:** Custom dares (use Drinking Dojo’s custom builder for wild ideas)  

### 2. Set the Standings

- Everyone starts at zero points.  
- Each dare or challenge completed earns you points (from 1 to 4, depending on difficulty).  
- If you fail or refuse a dare, you lose points.  

### 3. Draw the Wild Cards

- On your turn, draw a card.  
- The card’s suit decides your dare category; the number or face (2–10, J, Q, K, A) sets the intensity:  
  - 2–5: Easy  
  - 6–10: Medium  
  - J/Q/K: Hard  
  - Ace: Wildest dare in the deck (think: Fortnite dance-off, wedding toast in rhyme, etc.)  

### 4. Standings Shake-Up

- At random times (set by timer or when someone draws an Ace), trigger a “standings shuffle.”  
- Everyone swaps points with the player to their left, or everyone has to complete a group dare for bonus points.  

### 5. Victory Lap

- After every player has drawn five times, tally up the standings.  
- The player with the highest score wins bragging rights and gets to make a dare for everyone else.  
- The player at the bottom? They’re the official meme of the night—cue the viral drinking game punishment!  

## House Party Ideas for Extra Mayhem

- For couples drinking games, pair up and combine your points—losing couple does a duet dare.  
- Add a regional twist: try a UK “cheeky pint challenge,” an Aussie slang dare, or a Canadian trivia round.  
- Make it an event: try a Fortnite drinking game or Election Day drinking game to match the vibe.  

## Why Wild Card Standings Are the Ultimate Drinking Challenge

Nothing bonds a group like unpredictable drinking challenges, meme-worthy dares, and a leaderboard that flips in a second. Wild card standings keep everyone on their toes—just when you think you’re safe, you might be facing an NSFW dare or pulling off your best TikTok dance.
