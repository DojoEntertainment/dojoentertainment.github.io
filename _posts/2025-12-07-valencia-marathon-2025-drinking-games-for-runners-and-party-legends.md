Whether you’re cheering on friends from the sidelines, hosting a marathon watch party, or just looking for wild ways to spice up your next house gathering, we’ve got the ultimate drinking games playbook. Grab your favorite drinks, your crew, and get ready for a marathon of dare challenges, meme-worthy moments, and unforgettable party drinking games.

### Why Valencia Marathon 2025 Is the Perfect Party Vibe

Marathons aren’t just for the runners—spectators, friends, and fans get in on the action too. The Valencia Marathon 2025 is set to be a huge event, and with the right drinking games, you can keep the energy high from the first starting gun to the finish line. Whether you’re in the heart of Valencia or streaming from your flat in London, Toronto, Sydney, or Copenhagen, this is your cue to turn race day into a legendary party.

## Epic Valencia Marathon Drinking Game Rules

### What You’ll Need

- Your favorite drinks (beer, cocktails, seltzers—whatever your crew loves)
- A screen or device to watch the marathon (if you’re watching live)
- Dare cards or the [Drinking Dojo custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) for personalized challenges
- A sense of humor and a willingness to get a little wild

### How to Play

**1. Marathon Milestone Sips**

Take a sip every time:
- A runner hits a major checkpoint (5k, 10k, halfway, finish)
- The announcers mention “personal best”
- A runner throws water over their head
- The crowd goes wild on screen

**2. Dare Challenges for the Bold**

When the lead changes, pull a dare card! Think NSFW dares for the adults-only crowd or keep it meme drinking games style—“Text your last ex and say you’re training for a marathon,” anyone?

**3. Viral Drinking Games Twist**

Every time a viral moment happens (someone in costume, a wild sign in the crowd, or a runner photobombs the camera):
- The group votes on the best meme caption, and the loser takes two sips
- Bonus: Snap a pic and post your own meme with your crew

**4. Finish Line Finale**

Pick a runner to cheer for at the start. If your runner finishes in the top 10, you’re safe. If not, complete a dare challenge chosen by the group.
