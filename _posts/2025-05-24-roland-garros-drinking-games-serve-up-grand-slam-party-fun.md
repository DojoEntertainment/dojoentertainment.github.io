If you love tennis, wild dares, and unforgettable nights with friends, it’s time to rally for some Roland Garros-inspired drinking games. Whether you’re watching the clay court showdowns or just want to spice up your house party ideas, these party drinking games will have you cheering, laughing, and serving up serious fun. Break out the drinks, grab your squad, and turn every match point into a moment to remember!

## What You Need To Play Roland Garros Drinking Games

Before you ace these viral drinking games, here’s what you’ll need:

- Drinks of your choice (beer, cocktails, mocktails—whatever your crew loves)
- TV or streaming device to watch Roland Garros
- Scorecards or a notepad (optional, but great for tracking dares)
- Dare challenge cards or come up with your own
- Tennis-inspired memes for extra laughs (bonus points for meme drinking games)
- Good vibes and your best tennis banter

## Game 1: Fifth Set Frenzy Drinking Game

This custom drinking game builder classic is perfect for high-energy groups who want to keep the action going as long as the match does.

**How to Play:**

1. **Pick Your Player:** Each party guest chooses a tennis player to represent them in the match.
2. **Drink on Faults:** Whenever your player serves a fault, take a sip.
3. **Double Fault Double Dare:** If your player double faults, draw an NSFW dare from the stack and complete it—or double up on your drink.
4. **Break Point Boogie:** When there’s a break point, everyone must stand up and dance; the last person to start dancing drinks.
5. **Ace Race:** First person to shout “Ace!” when it happens chooses someone to finish their drink.
6. **Tiebreaker Challenge:** During any tiebreak, last person to grab a random object (like a tennis ball or shoe) has to take a dare challenge.

## Game 2: Meme Match Madness Drinking Game

For the meme lovers out there, this game brings the best of meme drinking games right to your living room.

**How to Play:**

1. **Meme Assignments:** Assign a classic tennis meme or viral drinking game meme to each player.
2. **Spot the Meme:** When the TV commentators or players do something meme-worthy (like a dramatic fall or angry outburst), everyone votes if it matches a meme. If it does, the meme’s “owner” picks someone to drink.
3. **Social Serve:** If a meme goes viral in your group chat during the match, everyone drinks and sends their own meme back.

## Game 3: Roland Garros Dare Rally Drinking Challenges

Craving wild dares and drinking challenges? This party game will have your group pushing the limits, just like the pros on the clay.

**How to Play:**

1. **Dare Stack:** Write down dares on slips of paper—include a few NSFW dares for the brave.
2. **Every Changeover:** At each changeover, draw a dare. Refuse, and you have to drink instead.
3. **Final Set Showdown:** In the final set, dares double in intensity—or drinks double if you skip.
