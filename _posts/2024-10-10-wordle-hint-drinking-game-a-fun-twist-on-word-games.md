## How to Play

The Wordle Hint Drinking Game is easy to learn and even easier to enjoy. Here's how it works

### Step 1 Set Up Your Wordle

Each player should have access to a device where they can play Wordle. You can play individually or as a team. The objective is to guess the Wordle of the day in as few tries as possible.

### Step 2 Establish Drinking Rules

Before diving into the game, agree on some drinking rules. Here are some suggestions to get you started

- **Missed Letter** For every incorrect letter guessed, take a sip
- **Wrong Word** If your guessed word doesn't contain any correct letters, take two sips
- **Hints Needed** If you ask for a hint from another player, take a sip
- **Failed to Solve** If you can't solve the Wordle in six tries, finish your drink

### Step 3 Play the Game

Start playing Wordle. As you guess, apply the agreed-upon drinking rules. Remember to keep the atmosphere light and friendly, and don't be afraid to get creative with new rules as you go along.

### Step 4 Celebrate the Winner

Once all players have completed their Wordle attempts, crown the winner. The player who solved the puzzle in the fewest guesses or used the least number of hints can assign an extra sip to any player of their choice.
