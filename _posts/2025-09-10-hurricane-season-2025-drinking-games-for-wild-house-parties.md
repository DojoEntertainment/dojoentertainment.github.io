Ready to shake things up? We’re bringing the storm inside with a hurricane-themed drinking game that’s perfect for adults in the US, UK, Canada, Australia, or Denmark looking for epic memories and a little mayhem.

## The Hurricane Drinking Game: Rules and How to Play

**What You’ll Need:**
- Your favorite drinks (beer, seltzers, cocktails—whatever floats your boat)
- A deck of cards
- A hurricane playlist (storm sounds, anyone?)
- Optional: Drinking Dojo’s [Custom Drinking Game Builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) to add wild meme drinking games, NSFW dares, or even Fortnite-style challenges

### Game Setup

1. Arrange everyone in a circle. The “Eye of the Storm” (the dealer) sits in the middle.
2. Shuffle the deck of cards and place it in the center.
3. Assign each player a drink and a “storm name”—get creative!

### How to Play

**Round One: The Gathering Storm**
- The Eye of the Storm draws a card and announces it. Each card has a drinking challenge:
    - **2–6**: “Light Rain” – Take one sip.
    - **7–10**: “Wind Picks Up” – Two sips and pass your drink to the left.
    - **Jack or Queen**: “Lightning Strike” – Last person to touch the floor drinks.
    - **King**: “Hurricane Warning” – Dealer creates a custom dare challenge for anyone.
    - **Ace**: “Evacuation” – Everyone stands up and swaps seats. If you’re last, finish your drink.

**Round Two: The Downpour**
- Every time thunder (or the thunder sound effect) hits in your playlist, everyone takes a sip.
- Add meme drinking games: Share your favorite hurricane meme. Best one gives out two drinks!

**Round Three: The Aftermath**
- The Eye of the Storm starts a dare challenge round using Drinking Dojo’s builder for NSFW dares, couples drinking games, or wild house party ideas. Losers? Finish their drinks or complete a forfeit.
