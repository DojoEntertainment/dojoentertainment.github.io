Ready to take your next party drinking game to meme-level mayhem? Meet Josh Pack — the viral drinking game your group will never forget. Whether you’re kicking off a house party, pre-gaming with your squad, or looking for fresh dare challenges, Josh Pack brings wild energy and hilarious dares into every round. Here’s everything you need to know to play, plus a few Drinking Dojo twists to make it unforgettable.

## What Is Josh Pack? | Viral Drinking Games Explained

Josh Pack is one of those drinking games that seems simple at first… until things get out of control (in the best way). It’s a party drinking game where everyone gets a shot at being the “Josh,” and no two rounds are ever the same. Think meme drinking games, a sprinkle of NSFW dares, and the kind of drinking challenges your group will talk about for weeks.

## What You Need To Play | Party Drinking Games Essentials

- A group of 3+ players (the more, the wilder)
- Your favorite drinks (beer, seltzers, cocktails — whatever fits your party vibe)
- A stack of paper and pens OR the [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) from Drinking Dojo
- A solid sense of humor and maybe a little courage

## How To Play Josh Pack | Step-by-Step Drinking Challenges Guide

### 1. Gather The Squad | House Party Ideas Starter

Circle up, make sure everyone’s drink is topped up, and choose one person to be the first “Josh.” (Their real name doesn’t have to be Josh — but bonus points if it is.)

### 2. Create The Pack | Custom Drinking Game Builder Tips

Each player writes down a wild dare, drinking challenge, or funny meme reference on a slip of paper. Not feeling creative? Use the Drinking Dojo custom drinking game builder to generate epic dares and viral drinking games content.

Throw all the slips in a hat or bowl. This is your “Josh Pack.”

### 3. The Josh Draw | Dare Challenges and Meme Drinking Games

The Josh picks a dare from the pack. They have two choices:

- **Complete the dare:** Go big or go home. If they nail it, everyone else in the circle takes a drink.
- **Pass:** If the dare’s too much, the Josh can pass — but they take double the drinks instead.

### 4. Rotate | Party Drinking Games Rotation

After each round, the Josh title rotates clockwise. Keep going until the dares run out or everyone taps out.

## Game-Changing Dare Ideas | NSFW Dares & Themed Challenges

Want to spice up your Josh Pack? Here are some crowd-pleasers:

- **NSFW dares** (if your group is brave enough)
- Meme drinking games references (think: “Do your best Fortnite dance or chug!”)
- Election day drinking game challenges (“Give a dramatic campaign speech with a mouthful of drink”)
- Wedding party games dares (“Propose to someone in your best British accent”)
- Couples drinking games twists (“Switch drinks with your partner for this round”)

Pro tip: The Drinking Dojo [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) has packs to fit every vibe, from chill to chaotic.
