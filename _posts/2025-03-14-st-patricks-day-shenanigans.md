St. Patrick's Day is renowned for its lively parades, vibrant green attire, and, of course, a bit of revelry. If you're hosting or attending a St. Patrick’s Day gathering, why not spice things up with some themed drinking games? Here’s a guide to some of the most entertaining games that will keep the laughter flowing as freely as the drinks.

### Leprechaun's Luck

**How to Play:**
1. Arrange guests in a circle, placing the pint glass in the center.
2. Shuffle the deck of cards and spread them face down around the glass.
3. Players take turns drawing a card from the circle.

   - **3**: Me - The player who drew the card drinks.

   - **Jack**: Make a Rule - Make a rule that everyone must follow. Anyone who breaks it drinks.
   - **Queen**: Question Master - If the Question Master asks you a question and you answer, you drink.
   - **King**: Pour some of your drink into the glass in the center. The person who draws the last King drinks the concoction.

   - **8, 9, 10**: Pick someone to drink.
