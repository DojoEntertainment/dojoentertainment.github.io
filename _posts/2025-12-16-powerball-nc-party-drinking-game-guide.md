Ready to turn your next house party into the stuff of legends? If you’re on the hunt for new party drinking games that will leave everyone laughing, look no further than Powerball NC. This viral drinking game trend is making waves from college dorms in the US to wild nights out in Australia. Whether you’re pregaming for a Fortnite drinking game marathon or searching for unforgettable dare challenges, Powerball NC brings the hype.

## What Is Powerball NC?

Powerball NC isn’t your average drinking game. Think of it as the perfect mashup of skill, chance, and hilarious mayhem—built to get everyone involved and keep the energy high. It's easy to set up, totally customizable, and works with any group size, making it a go-to addition to your lineup of party drinking games.

## What You Need

- **A soft ball or ping pong ball** (something easy to throw and catch)  
- **Shot glasses** (one per player)  
- **Drinks of choice** (beer, cocktails, or non-alcoholic for the designated drivers)  
- **A table or clear space**  
- **A timer or phone (optional)**  
- **Your wildest crew**  

## How to Play Powerball NC

### Setting Up

1. Gather everyone in a circle around the table.  
2. Place the shot glasses in front of each player.  
3. Assign a “Powerball Master” to start the first round.  

### The Rules

1. **The Powerball is tossed:** The Powerball Master throws the ball to another player at random.  
2. **Catch or Miss:**  
   - If the player catches it, they shout out a dare challenge for someone else (think NSFW dares or meme drinking games if your crew is bold).  
   - If they drop it, they take a drink.  
3. **Dare or Drink:**  
   - The chosen player must complete the dare or take a drink.  
   - If they refuse both, double the drinks!  
4. **The Ball Keeps Moving:**  
   - After each round, the Powerball is thrown to someone new.  
   - Keep the game going as long as the energy is up (or the drinks last).  

### Bonus House Rules

- **Fortnite Power Up:** If someone shouts a Fortnite dance mid-game and performs it, they can skip their next drink.  
- **Wedding Party Games Edition:** Swap out dares for wedding-themed challenges if you’re celebrating with the newlyweds.  
- **Election Day Challenge:** Make every dare political for a hilarious election day drinking game twist.
