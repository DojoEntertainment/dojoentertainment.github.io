Looking to elevate your next party with an exciting twist on a classic game? Dare Pong combines the fun of Beer Pong with the thrill of daring challenges.

Here’s everything you need to know about Dare Pong, including the best dares to use.

## What is Dare Pong?

Dare Pong is a variation of Beer Pong where each cup not only contains a drink but also a dare written on a piece of paper. When a player lands a ball in a cup, their opponent must drink the contents and complete the dare. It’s a fun and interactive way to add more excitement to the game.

## How to Play Dare Pong

### Setup
1. **Arrange the Cups**: Set up the cups in a triangular formation at each end of the table, just like in Beer Pong.
2. **Add the Dares**: Write dares on small pieces of paper and place one in each cup. Make sure the dares are folded so they can’t be read until the cup is made.
3. **Fill the Cups**: Pour a drink into each cup, making sure not to soak the paper too much.

### Rules
1. **Take Turns**: Players take turns trying to throw the ping pong ball into the opposing team’s cups.
2. **Complete the Dare**: When a ball lands in a cup, the opposing player must drink the contents and complete the dare inside.
3. **Winning the Game**: The first team to eliminate all the opposing team’s cups wins.
