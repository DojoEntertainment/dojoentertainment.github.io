Golf: the sport of patience, precision, and—let’s be real—perfect excuses to pour another drink. If you and your crew are tuning in to the DP World Tour Championship, why not turn every swing, putt, and bunker blunder into the ultimate party drinking game? Whether you're vibing in a dorm, throwing a house party, or hosting an epic wedding rager, we've got the drinking games, dare challenges, and meme drinking games to make the DP World Tour Championship unforgettable.

## Why Make Golf a Drinking Game?

Let’s face it: watching golf can be a marathon. But with the right party drinking games, you’ll turn every tense putt and wild swing into a viral drinking games moment. Plus, with our custom drinking game builder at Drinking Dojo, you can spice up your DP World Tour Championship watch party with house party ideas that even the caddies would envy.

## What You’ll Need

- Your favorite drinks (beer, cocktails, or mocktails if you’re pacing yourself)  
- Scorecards (print or digital)  
- Dare challenges (get wild with NSFW dares if it’s that kind of crowd)  
- Friends who love a good laugh and a little friendly competition  
- A TV or livestream of the DP World Tour Championship  

## How To Play The DP World Tour Championship Drinking Game

Ready to turn the green into your new favorite party arena? Here are the rules:

### Basic Rules

1. **Pick Your Players**  
   Assign each person a golfer (or a team). Whenever your golfer is on screen or takes a shot, prepare for action.

2. **Drink For Every Swing**  
   Every time your assigned golfer takes a swing, take a sip.

3. **Bogey Boogie**  
   If your golfer scores a bogey, you have to do a dare challenge or take a shot.

4. **Birdie Bonus**  
   Birdies are a big deal! When your golfer lands one, everyone else drinks.

5. **Ball In The Bunker**  
   If the ball lands in a sand trap, you must complete a meme drinking game dare—bonus points for creativity.

6. **Eagle Equals Double Trouble**  
   If an eagle is scored, everyone finishes their drink or pulls a card from your custom drinking game builder for a surprise challenge.

7. **Outfits On Point**  
   Spot a golfer wearing a wild hat or bold pants? The last person to call it out takes two sips.

### Dare Challenges

Mix in dare challenges to keep things spicy. Here are some to get you started:

- Speak in a golf commentator voice for the next five minutes.  
- Take a selfie with your “golf swing” and post it in your group chat.  
- NSFW dares for adventurous crowds—just keep it fun and consensual!
