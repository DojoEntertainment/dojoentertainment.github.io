## How to Play

The rules are simple and designed to enhance your fight night experience. Here's how you play

### Pre-Fight Setup

1. **Choose Fighters** - Each player picks a fighter who will be their champion for the night. You can draw names from a hat or simply choose your favorite.
2. **Set Up Drinks** - Make sure everyone has their drinks ready and within arm's reach.

### During the Fight

1. **Introduction Shots** - As the fighters make their way to the octagon, everyone takes a shot to kick off the night.

2. **Round Rules** - During each round, take a sip or a shot based on the following events
   - **Significant Strike** - Take a sip each time your fighter lands a significant strike.
   - **Takedown** - Take a shot if your fighter performs a takedown.
