## Why Margot Robbie Drinking Games Are a Party Power Move

Margot Robbie brings big energy to every role — and your party should be no different. These party drinking games blend memes, dares, and a splash of chaotic fun, perfect for any group that’s feeling bold. From wedding parties to chill nights in, you’ll have everyone quoting their fave Margot lines and taking on dare challenges in no time.

## What You’ll Need

- Drinks for everyone (cocktails, mocktails, or whatever’s your vibe)
- Dare cards or a custom drinking game builder (check out [Drinking Dojo’s tools](https://drinkingdojo.com) to make it wild)
- Meme-worthy props (think sunglasses, wigs, pink accessories)
- A sense of humor and zero shame

## How To Play: Margot Robbie Drinking Game Rules

Pick your Margot flick (or binge a few) and get ready to play. Here are some of the most viral drinking games rules you can try:

### Classic Movie Drinking Game

**Take a sip every time:**
- Margot’s character breaks the fourth wall
- Someone says the word “Barbie,” “Harley,” or “Naomi”
- Margot pulls off a costume change
- There’s an epic dance scene or musical moment

**Take two drinks if:**
- Someone in the room quotes along with the movie
- A wild plot twist drops
- There’s a meme-worthy moment you’ve seen on TikTok

**Finish your drink if:**
- Margot’s character delivers a legendary speech
- You spot a cameo from another A-lister

### Dare Challenges For the Brave

Make it spicy by adding in some dare challenges and NSFW dares (if the crew is up for it):

- Draw a dare card every time Margot does something totally unpredictable on screen
- Example dares:  
  - “Recreate Margot’s iconic dance scene”  
  - “Speak in an Aussie accent until your next turn”  
  - “Post a meme-worthy selfie to your story”  
  - “Swap seats with someone else at the table”
