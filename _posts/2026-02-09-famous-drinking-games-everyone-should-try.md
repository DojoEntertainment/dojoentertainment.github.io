Ready to turn your next party into a legend? There’s something about famous drinking games that brings friends together, breaks the ice, and creates those can’t-stop-laughing moments you’ll talk about for years. Whether you’re searching for viral drinking games, meme drinking games, or just the classics everyone loves, Drinking Dojo has your back with the best rules, dare challenges, and custom drinking game builder tools to take your night from basic to unforgettable.

Let’s break down the most famous party drinking games, how to play them, and what you need to get started.

## 1. Kings Cup — The Drinking Game Royalty

**What you need:**  
- A deck of cards  
- A large cup (the “King’s Cup”)  
- Drinks for everyone

**How to play:**  
1. Spread the cards in a circle around the King’s Cup.  
2. Players take turns drawing cards and performing the action assigned to each card. For example:  
    - 2: “You” – Pick someone to drink.  
    - 8: “Mate” – Choose a drinking buddy for the rest of the game.  
    - King: Pour some of your drink into the King’s Cup.  
3. The game ends when the last King is drawn — that person drinks the King’s Cup!

**Why it’s famous:**  
With wild dares, unexpected twists, and meme-worthy moments, Kings Cup is the ultimate party drinking game for breaking the ice and getting everyone involved.

## 2. Never Have I Ever — The Confession Classic

**What you need:**  
- Drinks  
- A group ready to spill secrets

**How to play:**  
1. Players sit in a circle. One starts by saying, “Never have I ever…” followed by something they’ve never done.  
2. Anyone who *has* done it takes a drink.  
3. Keep going until you’re all a little tipsy or someone’s secrets get too spicy!

**Pro tip:**  
Want to turn up the heat? Try adding NSFW dares for a next-level experience, perfect for couples drinking games or wild house party ideas.

## 3. Flip Cup — Fast, Furious, and Famous

**What you need:**  
- Plastic cups  
- A table  
- Drinks  
- Two teams

**How to play:**  
1. Teams line up on each side of the table.  
2. Players race to drink, then flip their cup upside down using only one hand.  
3. Once you flip successfully, the next teammate goes.  
4. First team to finish wins mega bragging rights.

**Flip Cup** isn’t just a college staple—it’s a viral drinking game that you’ll see everywhere from backyard BBQs to wedding party games.

## 4. Meme Drinking Games — The Modern Mayhem

Why not combine your love for memes and drinking? Meme drinking games turn trending jokes, viral videos, and pop culture into party fuel.
