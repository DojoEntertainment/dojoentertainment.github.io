Game day just got a whole lot rowdier. Whether you’re a die-hard Packers or Browns fan or just here for the snacks and chaos, why not turn the next game into an unforgettable drinking challenge? With our Packers vs Browns prediction drinking game, you’ll get all the daring, meme-worthy fun Drinking Dojo is famous for—plus a few new twists to keep everyone on their toes.

## Why a Prediction Drinking Game?

Prediction drinking games are the ultimate party drinking games because they crank up the excitement and keep everyone invested until the last play. You don’t need to be a football expert—just bring your best guesses, your thirst for dares, and your crew’s wildest energy.

## What You’ll Need

- Drinks of your choice (responsibly, of course)  
- Shot glasses or cups  
- A way to keep score (phone, notepad, or even our [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com))  
- The game on TV or a live stream  
- A group of fun-loving friends  

## How To Play Packers vs Browns Prediction Drinking Game

### 1. Make Your Predictions

Before kickoff, each player writes down five predictions about the game. Go bold, go weird, or go meme-worthy—think “Packers score first with a field goal,” “Browns get an interception in the first half,” or “The announcer mentions cheese at least once.”

### 2. Set Your Dare Challenges

Assign a dare challenge for each incorrect prediction. You can use classic dares, NSFW dares (if you’re feeling spicy and everyone’s on board), or come up with your own. Drinking Dojo’s meme drinking games and dare packs are perfect for this—just saying.

### 3. Game Time Rules

- **Every correct prediction:** Everybody else drinks.  
- **Every wrong prediction:** The person who guessed wrong does their assigned dare or takes a drink.  
- **Viral moments:** If anything wild happens (massive touchdown, meme-worthy celebration, streaker on the field), pause and everyone does a quick dare challenge.  

### 4. Bonus Drinking Challenges

Up the ante with these side quests:  
- **Fortnite dance challenge:** If the camera catches a touchdown celebration dance, last person to stand up and floss takes a shot.  
- **Wedding party games twist:** If a proposal happens on screen, everyone must toast (and finish their drink).  

### 5. Winners and Legends

At the end of the game, tally up who got the most predictions right. Loser has to do a wild dare challenge chosen by the group. Winner gets bragging rights—and maybe a pass on the next round.

## Perfect For Any Party

This game is not just for football superfans. It’s ideal for house party ideas, couples drinking games, or even as a viral drinking game to spice up your social feed. With Drinking Dojo, you can even build your own custom drinking game for any matchup—football, Fortnite, or Election Day.
