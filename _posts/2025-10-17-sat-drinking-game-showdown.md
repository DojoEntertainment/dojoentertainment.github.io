## What You’ll Need

- A group of 3+ friends (the more, the merrier)  
- Drinks of your choice (keep it safe and fun)  
- A deck of cards (optional, but highly recommended)  
- The [Drinking Dojo custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) for next-level dare challenges and memes  
- A timer or phone

## How To Play Sat Drinking Game Showdown

### 1. Set Up Your Arena

Sit in a circle. Place your drinks within reach. If you’ve got the Drinking Dojo app or site open, queue up your favorite meme drinking games or NSFW dares for extra spice.

### 2. Shuffle the Deck

If using cards, shuffle and place in the center. Otherwise, use the Drinking Dojo custom game builder to generate random challenges.

### 3. Take Turns Drawing or Rolling

- Draw a card or spin the virtual dare wheel.  
- Each card or prompt comes with a challenge—think viral drinking games, wild dares, or meme-inspired actions.  
- Complete the challenge, or take a drink if you’re too chicken.

### 4. Level Up With Dare Challenges

Every 20 minutes, the whole group must complete a team dare. Examples:  
- “Everyone speak in an accent until the next round or drink twice.”  
- “Last person to text ‘SATURDAYYYY’ in the group chat drinks.”  
- “Fortnite dance-off—the loser drinks.”

### 5. Endgame

First player to complete 10 challenges (or survive the night without tapping out) is crowned the Sat Showdown Legend. Losers? They get to post their worst dare moment to the group chat or social media.

## Top Tips for Maximum Fun

- Add in themed rounds: Try a **Fortnite drinking game** round, or bring out the **election day drinking game** dares for extra LOLs.  
- Throw in some **NSFW dares** if your crowd is up for it—just keep it consensual!  
- Planning a wedding? Swap in some **wedding party games** challenges and toast to the happy couple.  
- For couples, use the builder for **couples drinking games** dares that’ll have you laughing (and maybe blushing).
