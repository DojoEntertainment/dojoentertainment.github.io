   - **Queen**: Ask a "most likely to" question. [Here's a great list of questions](https://drinkingdojo.com/games/most-likely-to).

   - **Number Cards**: The player to the right takes as many sips as the number on the card.

3. **Pass the Calavera**: After each turn, the player passes the calavera to the person on their left. If the calavera falls, the person responsible must take a sip.

4. **Music Pause**: At random intervals, pause the music. The last person to freeze must share a fun fact about Dia de los Muertos or take a sip.

5. **Game End**: The game continues until the deck is used up or you decide to move on to another activity.
