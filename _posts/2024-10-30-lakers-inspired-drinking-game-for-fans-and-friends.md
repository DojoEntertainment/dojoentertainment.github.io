Whether you're a die-hard Lakers fan or just love a good party game, this activity is sure to keep the energy high and the spirits even higher. Let's dive into the rules and how to play

## Materials Needed

- A TV or streaming device to watch a Lakers game
- Drinks of choice (beer, wine, cocktails, or non-alcoholic options)
- Shot glasses or cups
- A Lakers jersey or any purple and gold apparel to amp up the spirit
- Optional snacks to keep everyone fueled during the game

## Basic Rules

Here are the rules to keep the excitement flowing as smoothly as your drinks

1. **Tip-Off Toast**: Start the game with a toast as the referee blows the whistle for tip-off. Everyone takes a sip to get warmed up

2. **Three-Point Cheers**: Every time a Lakers player scores a three-pointer, everyone raises their glass and takes a drink in celebration

3. **Foul Shots**: If a Lakers player is fouled and makes both free throws, take two sips. If they miss one, take one sip. If both are missed, everyone takes a shot

4. **Fast Break Frenzy**: When the Lakers score off a fast break, the last person to raise their drink has to take an extra sip

5. **Timeout Trivia**: During timeouts, challenge each other with Lakers trivia questions. The person with the most correct answers at the end of the game gets to assign drinks to other players

6. **Overtime Overhaul**: If the game goes into overtime, finish your drink and prepare for an extra thrilling experience

## How to Play

1. Gather your friends and set up in front of a TV or any screen streaming the Lakers game

2. Assign someone to be the rule master who keeps track of the game and makes sure everyone follows the rules

3. Distribute drinks and make sure everyone has their Lakers spirit gear on

4. Follow the rules as the game unfolds. Remember to drink responsibly and stay hydrated

5. Enjoy the camaraderie, competition, and laughter as you cheer on the Lakers together

## Play Responsibly

While this drinking game is meant to enhance your viewing experience and bring friends together, it's important to drink responsibly. Keep an eye on how much you're consuming and ensure everyone has a safe way to get home after the game
