## Why Pair Drinking Games With the French Open Schedule?

The French Open isn’t just about epic rallies and clay-court drama—it’s also the perfect excuse to gather your crew and unleash some viral drinking games. Whether you’re all-in for the finals or just here for the memes, the right party drinking games take every ace and double fault to a whole new level. Plus, with a custom drinking game builder, you can tailor the fun to fit every round, match, and inside joke.

## Materials You’ll Need for Your French Open Drinking Games

- Drinks (beer, cocktails, mocktails—your call)
- Printed French Open schedule (or have it pulled up on your phone)
- Cups or shot glasses
- Notepads for keeping score
- Dare cards (make your own or grab a deck from [Drinking Dojo](https://drinkingdojo.com))
- Optional: Tennis gear for bonus memes

## French Open Schedule Drinking Game Rules

### Game 1: Rally Sips

**How to Play:**
- Everyone picks a player to root for during the match.
- Whenever your player wins a point, you take a sip.
- If your player loses a point, you hand out a sip to someone else.
- If there’s a break of serve: everyone drinks!

### Game 2: Tennis Meme Madness

**How to Play:**
- Before the match, write down classic tennis memes (think: “You cannot be serious!” or epic Nadal grunts).
- When any meme-worthy moment happens, the first to call it out gets to assign a dare challenge.
- NSFW dares keep everyone on their toes—use them wisely!

### Game 3: Dare Sets

**How to Play:**
- For each set, draw a dare card.
- At the end of the set, whoever’s player is losing completes the dare.
- Double points if you use the custom drinking game builder to add your own spicy (or meme-worthy) dares.

### Game 4: Couples Drinking Games—Doubles Edition

**How to Play:**
- Pair up! Each couple roots for a doubles team.
- Every time your team wins a volley, high-five and sip.
- If your team loses a game, complete a dare together.
- Last couple standing wins a prize (or just bragging rights).
