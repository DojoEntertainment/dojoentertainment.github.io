## What Is the King Charles Drinking Game?

King Charles is a party drinking game that’s all about luck, strategy, and not spilling your drink when laughter hits. It’s the perfect blend of classic card games and wild dare challenges. Each card unlocks a different rule, dare, or drinking challenge, making every round unpredictable and unforgettable. Bonus: It’s easy to set up, and you probably already have everything you need.

## What You’ll Need

- A standard deck of 52 cards (no jokers)
- A large cup or pint glass (the “King’s Cup”)
- Drinks of your choice (beer, cider, cocktails, non-alcoholic options—your dojo, your rules)
- A table or flat surface
- Friends ready for some royal mayhem

## How To Play King Charles

### Setup

1. Sit everyone in a circle with the King’s Cup in the center.
2. Spread the deck of cards face down around the cup.
3. Each player takes turns drawing a card. Each card means a different action, dare, or rule.
