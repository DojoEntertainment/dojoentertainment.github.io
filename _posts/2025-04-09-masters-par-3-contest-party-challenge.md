Welcome to the ultimate guide for hosting a fun-filled night with your friends inspired by the "Masters Par 3 Contest." This unique party challenge combines the thrill of golf with the excitement of a social gathering, promising laughter and camaraderie. Whether you're a golf enthusiast or just looking for a new way to entertain your guests, this game is sure to be a hit at your next get-together.

### The Concept

The Masters Par 3 Contest is a famous event in the golfing world, held annually on the Wednesday before the Masters Tournament. It's a playful and less formal way for professional golfers to showcase their skills. Drawing inspiration from this event, we've crafted a party game that blends the spirit of golf with a refreshing twist—drinks!

### Materials Needed

To get started, you’ll need the following:

- **Mini Golf Set**: You can purchase an indoor mini-golf kit or DIY your own course using household items.
- **Scorecards**: Create simple scorecards for tracking players' performance.
- **Drinks**: Choose your preferred beverages—these could be alcoholic or non-alcoholic based on your guests' preferences.
- **Shot Glasses**: For the penalties, explained in the rules below.
- **Decorations**: Add a golf-themed touch with green tablecloths and golf ball centerpieces.

### How to Play

1. **Set Up the Course**: Arrange your mini-golf course in a spacious area. Use obstacles like cups, books, or small furniture to make each hole challenging.

2. **Form Teams**: Divide your guests into teams of two or more. Players will take turns trying to sink their ball in the fewest strokes possible.

3. **Scoring**: Just like in the Par 3 Contest, each hole has a par. Players attempt to complete the hole in the designated number of strokes. 

4. **Rules**:
   - If a player completes the hole in par or under, they remain "sober" for that round.
   - If a player exceeds par, they must take a sip of their drink.
   - For every stroke over par, the player takes an additional sip.
   - A hole-in-one results in a "water hazard" penalty for all other players, requiring them to take a shot from a designated shot glass.

5. **Winning**: The team with the lowest total score at the end of the course is declared the winner. You can offer a small prize, such as a golf-themed accessory or a bottle of the group's favorite drink.

### Tips for Success

- **Keep it Safe**: Encourage responsible drinking and ensure everyone has a safe way to get home.
- **Theme It Up**: Encourage guests to wear golf attire to enhance the atmosphere.
- **Practice**: Before the game starts, allow players to practice their putts to get familiar with the course.
