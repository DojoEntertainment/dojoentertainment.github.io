Ready to turn your Friday night into absolute chaos? Whether you’re chilling in a dorm, hosting a house party, or calling dibs on the aux at a wedding afterparty, today is the perfect excuse to break out the best drinking games. At Drinking Dojo, we’re all about bending the rules, spicing up dares, and making party drinking games go viral.

Grab your favorite drink, get your wildest friends, and let the games begin.

## 1. Meme Mayhem: The Ultimate Meme Drinking Game

**What you need:**  
- A deck of meme cards (print, use your phone, or find some online)  
- Drinks for everyone

**How to play:**  
1. Lay out a selection of meme cards face up.  
2. The “judge” for the round calls out a scenario (like “When someone says they’re ‘just having one drink’”).  
3. Everyone picks the meme that fits best and points to it.  
4. The judge picks their favorite—winner gives out 2 sips, everyone else drinks.  
5. Rotate the judge and repeat.  

**Why it’s great:**  
Combines viral drinking games with meme culture for pure mayhem. Bonus: customize your own meme cards with our [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com).

## 2. Dare Roulette

**What you need:**  
- Notepad or phone  
- Drinks  
- A spinner app or a bottle

**How to play:**  
1. Everyone writes a dare challenge on a slip of paper or notes app (keep it just this side of NSFW—unless you’re feeling bold).  
2. Place the dares in a bowl.  
3. Spin the bottle or use an app to pick who goes next.  
4. Draw a dare. Complete it or drink. Refuse both? Take a double shot.

**Why it’s great:**  
Dare challenges always get wilder as the night goes on. Perfect for breaking the ice or testing friendships.

## 3. Fortnite Drinking Game

**What you need:**  
- Fortnite (console, PC, or mobile)  
- Drinks  
- Your squad

**How to play:**  
1. Every time you land in a “hot drop” zone, everyone drinks.  
2. Take a sip every time you get eliminated.  
3. If you’re the last one alive in your squad, give out drinks equal to your kill count that round.  
4. Victory Royale? Everyone else finishes their drink.

**Why it’s great:**  
Blends gaming and party drinking games for those who don’t want to leave the couch.

## 4. Couples Chaos

**What you need:**  
- A set of couples (or pairs of friends)  
- Drinks  
- List of couple-specific dares or questions

**How to play:**  
1. Each couple answers questions about each other (“Who’s more likely to forget an anniversary?”).  
2. Get it wrong? Drink. Get it right? Give out a drink.  
3. Add NSFW dares if you’re feeling spicy.

**Why it’s great:**  
Couples drinking games get everyone laughing, blushing, and maybe learning a thing or two.

## 5. Wedding Party Games Remix

**What you need:**  
- Drinks  
- Wedding playlist  
- List of dares and challenges

**How to play:**  
1. Every time someone says “cheers,” everyone drinks.  
2. If the DJ plays a love song, last person to stand up drinks.  
3. Bride and groom do a dare challenge chosen by the group.

**Why it’s great:**  
Takes wedding party games up a notch, so even your nan might join in (with or without the tequila).
