Twice a year, the clocks change ‚Äî and somehow, time gets even weirder. Whether you‚Äôre gaining an extra hour or losing precious sleep, why not turn the chaos of daylight savings into an unforgettable party? At Drinking Dojo, we turn every excuse into a wild night, and this time change is no exception. Grab your squad, stack up the drinks, and get ready for daylight savings drinking games that will have everyone laughing their way through the time warp.

## Why Daylight Savings Calls for Party Drinking Games

Let‚Äôs face it, daylight savings is confusing, hilarious, and a little bit annoying. So why not turn it into a legendary pregame, house party, or even a wedding after-party? With a mix of viral drinking games, meme-worthy dares, and custom challenges, you‚Äôll never look at the clock the same way again.

## The Daylight Savings Drinking Game

### What You Need

- A group of fun-loving legends (3+ players)
- Your drink of choice (beers, cocktails, or mocktails for the sober squad)
- A phone or smart speaker for time announcements
- Dare cards or a [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) for wild NSFW dares
- Optional: Meme cards for extra laughs

### How to Play

#### **Set the Mood**

- Pick your favorite house party playlist.
- Set all clocks in the room to different times ‚Äî just to mess with everyone.

#### **Game Rules**

1. **Time Check Challenge**
   - Every 15 minutes, someone yells ‚ÄúWhat time is it?‚Äù  
   - Everyone takes turns guessing the time (no phones allowed).
   - Closest guess gives out 2 sips, furthest away takes 2 sips.

2. **Spring Forward, Fall Back**
   - If you ‚Äúlose‚Äù an hour (spring forward), everyone has to finish their drink when the clock hits 2:00 am.
   - If you ‚Äúgain‚Äù an hour (fall back), everyone must take a shot or complete a dare challenge when the clock repeats 1:00 am.

3. **Daylight Dare Round**
   - Each time someone says ‚Äúdaylight‚Äù or ‚Äúsavings‚Äù by accident, they draw a dare card.
   - For the truly brave, use NSFW dares for extra spice.

4. **Meme Minute**
   - Once every hour, pause the party for a meme showdown.
   - Each person shows their best meme about time, clocks, or mornings.
   - Group votes for the funniest; loser takes a drink or performs a viral dare.

5. **Couples Twist**
   - Playing with partners? Pair up and compete as teams.
   - Winning pair each round gives out drinks, losing pair does a silly wedding party game dare.
