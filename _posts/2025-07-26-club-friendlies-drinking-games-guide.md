If you‚Äôre looking for a way to kick off your next house party, spice up your pregame, or just bring the squad together for some wild times, club friendlies drinking games are where it‚Äôs at. Whether you‚Äôre a footy fanatic or just there for the vibes, these party drinking games bring everyone into the action‚Äîno athletic skills required.

Forget just watching the match‚Äîturn every goal, near-miss, or meme-worthy moment into a dare challenge. Get ready to create epic memories (and maybe a few NSFW dares) that‚Äôll keep the group chat buzzing for weeks.

## What Are Club Friendlies Drinking Games?

Club friendlies are those fun, sometimes chaotic soccer matches that happen before the real season kicks off. But here‚Äôs the twist: you can turn any friendly match into an unforgettable party drinking game with just a few simple rules and a little bit of creativity. No matter if you‚Äôre watching Liverpool vs. Barca or just streaming a local club match with your mates, this is the ultimate way to blend meme drinking games with actual sports action.

## What You‚Äôll Need

- A TV or stream showing the club friendly match  
- Drinks of choice (beer, seltzers, cocktails, or non-alc if that‚Äôs your thing)  
- Shot glasses or cups  
- A list of drinking challenges (customize with our [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com))  
- Optional: Scoreboard, meme cards, dare challenges  

## How To Play Club Friendlies Drinking Games

Here‚Äôs how to turn any club friendly into a viral drinking game everyone will want to try:

### 1. Set Up Your Game Rules

Pick from the classic rules below, or go wild and throw in your own dare challenges:

- **Goal Gulp**: Every time a goal is scored, everyone takes a drink. The person who predicted the scorer gets to assign a shot.  
- **Missed Opportunity**: For every shot that misses the goal, take a sip.  
- **Ref‚Äôs Whistle**: When the ref blows the whistle for a foul, the last person to raise their glass does a dare.  
- **Meme Moment**: If the commentator says something meme-worthy or a player flops dramatically, the group votes on a dare for the best reaction.  
- **Goal Celebration**: If a player does a wild celebration, everyone mimics it‚Äîlast one to join drinks!  
- **Own Goal**: Double shot for everyone if someone scores an own goal.  

### 2. Add Some Dare Challenges

Club friendlies can be unpredictable, so throw in some custom dares to keep things spicy:

- **NSFW dares for the bold** (just keep it friendly!)  
- Quick-fire meme challenges (think: re-create a viral meme with your squad)  
- ‚ÄúFortnite dance-off‚Äù for the next commercial break  

### 3. Keep Score or Go Free-For-All

You can keep track of points and crown a winner, or just let the chaos unfold. For extra fun, use our custom drinking game builder to create personal rules based on your group‚Äôs inside jokes or favorite players.
