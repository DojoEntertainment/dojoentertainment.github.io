Ready to turn your next hangout into an epic showdown? If fantasy football has you glued to the TV, why not raise the stakes with party drinking games inspired by week 5 fantasy rankings? At Drinking Dojo, we’re all about making every Sunday (or Monday, or Thursday...) unforgettable—whether you’re cheering for touchdowns or downing dares.

Let’s break down how to turn fantasy rankings into the ultimate viral drinking game for your crew, featuring wild dares, custom rules, and, of course, memes that hit harder than your favorite running back.

## How To Play: Fantasy Drinking Game Showdown

### What You’ll Need
- **Your Week 5 Fantasy Rankings** (online or printed)
- Drinks of choice (beer, cocktails, mocktails—your dojo, your rules)
- A group of friends (2+ players is best)
- Dare cards or a list of NSFW dares (optional but highly recommended for max mayhem)
- Scoreboard (whiteboard, notepad, or your phone)

### Setup

1. **Pick Your Players:** Each person chooses a fantasy team/player from the week 5 rankings.
2. **Set The Rules:** Decide if you’re playing by real fantasy matchups or making up your own (Drinking Dojo’s [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) is perfect for this).
3. **Gather Your Materials:** Drinks, dare challenges, and a way to track points.

### The Rules

#### Basic Version

- Every time your chosen player scores a touchdown in real life, everyone else drinks.
- If your player fumbles, *you* drink.
- Field goal? Everyone drinks, but kicker’s player drinks twice.
- Interception? Split a dare challenge between the person with the defense and the person with the intercepted player.

#### Party Mode

- At the end of each quarter, the lowest-scoring fantasy player must draw a meme drinking game card or complete a NSFW dare.
- Bonus round: Predict next quarter’s top scorer. If you’re right, give out drinks. If you’re wrong, take a drinking challenge yourself.
- Losing fantasy team at the end of the game? Spin the wheel for a wild dare, or take shots with the wedding party games crowd (if you’re vibing at a wedding afterparty).

## Drinking Game Variations

- **Couples Drinking Games:** Pair up and combine your fantasy scores. Lowest couple does a couple’s dare.
- **House Party Ideas:** Make a bracket for everyone’s fantasy picks and add new drinking challenges each round.
- **Viral Drinking Games:** Share your best dares or wildest forfeits on social and tag Drinking Dojo for a chance to go viral.
