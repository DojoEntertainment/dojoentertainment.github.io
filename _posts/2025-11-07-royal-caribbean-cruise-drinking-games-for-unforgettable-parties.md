Planning a Royal Caribbean cruise with your wildest crew? Between sun-drenched decks, endless buffets, and night-after-night of dancing, there’s only one thing missing: party drinking games that turn good times into legendary memories. Whether you’re pregaming before a karaoke showdown or kicking back in your cabin, adding drinking challenges or meme drinking games can take your cruise to the next level.

This is your go-to guide for epic drinking games on a Royal Caribbean cruise. We’re talking viral drinking games, custom dares, and house party ideas that’ll make even the ship’s captain want to join in. Ready, set, cheers!

## Why Drinking Games Are a Must on a Royal Caribbean Cruise

- **Break the ice with new friends** from around the world  
- **Level up the party** in your stateroom or on the sundeck  
- **Make every night unique** with custom drinking game builder options  
- **Create meme-worthy moments** perfect for your Instagram story  

## Top Drinking Games for Your Royal Caribbean Adventure

### 1. Cruise Cards

**Materials Needed:**  
- A deck of playing cards  
- Your favorite drinks  

**How to Play:**  
- Sit in a circle. Spread the cards face down in the center.  
- On your turn, draw a card and follow the rule assigned:  

  - **Ace:** Waterfall (everyone starts drinking, you can stop when the person before you stops)  
  - **King:** Make a rule (e.g., no first names, or everyone speaks in pirate accents)  
  - **Queen:** Question Master (ask questions until someone slips up)  
  - **Jack:** Dare Challenge (the group dares you—think NSFW dares if you’re feeling bold)  
  - **2–10:** Drink that number of sips  

**Pro Tip:** Use the [Drinking Dojo custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) to add cruise-specific dares!  

### 2. Deck Dash Dare

**Materials Needed:**  
- Smartphone or notepad  
- List of dares (bonus points for viral drinking games and meme challenges)  

**How to Play:**  
- Each person writes down three dares (e.g., “Ask the bartender for their wildest cocktail recipe,” “Photobomb a group selfie,” “Start a conga line”).  
- Place them in a hat.  
- On your turn, pick a dare and complete it—or drink!  

**Cruise Vibes:** Mix in wedding party games or couples drinking games if you’re celebrating a special occasion onboard.  

### 3. Ship Showdown

**Materials Needed:**  
- Nothing but your wild imaginations and drinks  

**How to Play:**  
- The group comes up with cruise-themed drinking challenges (e.g., first person to spot a dolphin, last to find the buffet, etc.)  
- Winner assigns drinks; loser completes a dare challenge.  

**Make it Spicy:** Toss in NSFW dares after dark or tailor challenges for special cruise nights like formal dinners or themed parties.  

## Safe and Smart Sipping

- Hydrate! Cruise parties are a marathon, not a sprint.  
- Know your limits—no one wants to miss the next port because they’re nursing a hangover.  
- Always follow Royal Caribbean’s onboard rules about where you can drink.
