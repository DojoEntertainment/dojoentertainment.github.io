title: The Drinking Game That Turns a Pizza Box Into Pure Chaos
---

Ever looked at an empty pizza box after a party and thought: *“This could ruin our lives”*?  
Good. Because that’s exactly what this drinking game does.

This ridiculously simple game takes **one pizza box, one coin, and a group of friends**—and somehow turns it into a night nobody fully remembers but everyone talks about for weeks.

No cards. No apps. No prep. Just chaos.

### What Is the Pizza Box Drinking Game?

The Pizza Box Drinking Game is a DIY party game where **you create the rules as you play**. Every coin toss adds a new punishment, challenge, or inside joke to the box, slowly transforming it into a minefield of bad decisions.

By the end of the night, the box looks like a conspiracy board—and the group is absolutely gone.

### What You Need

You don’t need much to get started:

1. An empty pizza box (or any large piece of cardboard)
2. A coin
3. Markers or pens
4. Drinks
5. At least 3 friends who make questionable choices

That’s it. Seriously.

### How to Play

**Setup**

1. Place the pizza box in the middle of the group.
2. Everyone writes their name somewhere on the box and draws a circle around it.
3. Decide one important rule upfront: *What happens if the coin hits a line?* (Most groups allow a re-throw.)

**Gameplay**

1. Players take turns tossing the coin onto the box.
2. What happens next depends on where it lands:

- **On a name:** That person drinks.
- **On an empty spot:** You create a new rule, write it down, and circle it.
- **On an existing rule:** You must follow the rule immediately. No arguing.

The game continues until the box is full—or until the group decides things have gone far enough.

### Why This Game Escalates Fast

At first, rules are innocent:  
“Take 2 sips.”  
“Give 1 sip.”

Then something shifts.

Rules get personal. Circles get bigger. Someone invents a rule they immediately regret. Suddenly, the entire group is terrified of one specific corner of the box.

That’s the magic.

### The Upgrade Most Groups End Up Making

After one or two nights, many people realize two things:
- Cardboard gets messy
- Permanent marker decisions are… permanent

That’s why a lot of groups switch to a **reusable dry-erase version** of the game.

### Some Rule Ideas (Use With Caution)

- Speak in an accent until someone else hits this rule
- Choose one player who drinks every time *anyone* drinks
- Last photo in your phone decides who drinks
- Erase and rewrite any rule on the board
- Invent a rule that only affects you (brave or stupid—your call)

Pro tip: erasable rules make people much bolder.

### When Does the Game End?

Officially? When the box is full.  
In reality? When someone says, *“Okay, one more round”* for the third time.

There’s no winner. Only memories… and screenshots.
