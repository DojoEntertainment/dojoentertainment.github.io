## What You’ll Need for Your NBA Drinking Games

- NBA game on TV (playoffs or regular season—dealer’s choice)
- Drinks of your choice (beer, cocktails, or something daring)

## NBA Drinking Game Rules and Dare Challenges

Here’s how to get your crew in the zone with the best drinking games:

### Basic NBA Drinking Game Rules

**Pre-Game Setup:**
1. Split into two teams—each picks a side to cheer for.
2. Print or write out the drinking rules, or use Drinking Dojo’s custom tools.

**During the Game:**
- **Every basket scored:** Take one sip.
- **Three-pointer made:** Shooter’s team takes two sips; other team takes one.
- **Turnover:** Player who last touched the ball picks someone for a dare challenge.
- **Personal foul:** Everyone on the fouling team drinks.
- **Timeout:** Quick-fire meme drinking games—pass around a meme and the person who laughs first drinks.
- **Buzzer-beater:** Last-second shot? Everyone finishes their drink!

### Dare Challenges For Extra Hype in Your Party Drinking Games

Mix things up with these wild dare challenges:
- **Missed Free Throw:** Attempt a goofy dance or down a shot.
- **Technical Foul:** NSFW dares—think truth-or-dare with a twist.
