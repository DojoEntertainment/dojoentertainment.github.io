There’s something electric about a party in the USA—whether you’re at a backyard BBQ in California, a rooftop bash in New York, or a college house party in Texas. And what’s the secret sauce to turning a regular night into one for the history books? Epic drinking games, wild dare challenges, and meme-worthy moments you’ll laugh about for years.

Whether you’re a party pro or just looking for house party ideas that’ll break the ice, we’ve rounded up the best party drinking games that are taking the USA by storm. Plus, we’ve got the rules, how to play, and everything you need to kick off a legendary night.

## The Red Cup Classic: Kings (Ring of Fire)

**Kings** is an American drinking game staple—perfect for big groups and wild stories. It’s easy, chaotic, and endlessly customizable with our [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com).

**What you need:**
- A deck of cards  
- A big cup (the “King’s Cup”)  
- Drinks for everyone  
- A table (or any flat surface)  

**How to play:**
1. Spread the cards face-down in a circle around the King’s Cup.
2. Players take turns drawing cards and follow the rule for each card (e.g., 2 is “you,” 5 is “guys,” 8 is “mate,” etc.).
3. Each King drawn means pouring some of your drink into the cup. The person who draws the last King chugs the King’s Cup!

**Why it’s a hit:**  
It’s the ultimate meme drinking game—rules can be tweaked, dares added, and chaos guaranteed.

## Flip Cup: Fast Hands, Faster Laughs

Looking for viral drinking games that always get the crowd hyped? Flip Cup is your go-to.

**What you need:**
- Plastic cups  
- A long table  
- Drinks  
- Two teams  

**How to play:**
1. Teams line up on opposite sides of the table.
2. Each player must drink their cup, then flip it upside down using only one hand.
3. The next teammate goes once the previous cup is flipped.
4. First team to finish wins eternal bragging rights.

**Pro tip:** Make it spicy with some NSFW dares for the losing team!

## Election Day Drinking Game: Democracy Gets Saucy

USA party culture loves a good themed event. On Election Day, spice up your watch party with a drinking game that’ll keep spirits high—no matter your candidate.

**What you need:**
- Drinks  
- TV or streaming device  
- List of triggers (e.g., every time a state is called, a politician says "the American people," or a meme-worthy moment happens)

**How to play:**
1. Everyone picks a candidate or party.
2. Whenever your chosen person or party is mentioned, you drink.
3. Add dare challenges for bonus fun—like sending a meme in the group chat or doing your best political impression.
