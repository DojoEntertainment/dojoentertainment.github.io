Election Day: you either love the drama, dread the news cycle, or just want an excuse to gather your crew and make some memories—preferably with a drink in hand. Whether it’s Election Day in the US, UK, Canada, Australia, or even Denmark, there’s one thing we can all agree on: party drinking games are the real winner of the night.

If you’re asking, “is today election day?” and the answer is yes, call your friends, prep your drinks, and get ready to play the ultimate election day drinking game. No matter your political leanings, this drinking challenge is all about fun, laughter, and making every result a reason to celebrate.

## What You Need for the Election Day Drinking Game

- Your favorite drinks (beer, seltzers, cocktails, whatever fuels your ballot)
- A TV or live stream of the election coverage
- A list of election clichés and phrases (we’ve got your back below)
- The official [Drinking Dojo custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) for bonus dares and meme-worthy challenges

## Classic Election Day Drinking Game Rules

This one’s easy to set up and endlessly customizable. Here’s how to play:

### Setup

1. **Gather everyone around a screen**: The bigger the better. Election graphics need to be seen.
2. **Pick your poison**: Beer, wine, cocktails, or non-alcoholic if you want to keep it chill.
3. **Print or display the rules**: No one wants to argue when the results are coming in.

### How to Play

Every time you hear or see one of these (trust us, it’ll happen a lot), take a sip:

- “Too close to call”
- “Historic turnout”
- “Swing state” or “battleground”
- A candidate’s awkward high-five or forced smile
- Someone says “democracy in action”
- A technical glitch (shots for everyone if the screen freezes)
- Exit polls graphics that look like a rainbow exploded

**Bonus rounds:**

- If someone in the room starts an election debate: dare them to do an NSFW dare or meme drinking game challenge from Drinking Dojo.
- If your candidate wins a state/region: everyone else drinks.
- If a surprise happens (think wild upsets or viral moments): everyone does a meme-worthy dare.

### Dare Challenges for the Brave

Ready to spice it up? Add in these dare challenges for the next-level party drinking game experience:

- **Election Speech:** Give a 30-second victory speech as if you just won the presidency/prime ministership.
- **Impersonation Station:** Imitate a candidate or newscaster until someone guesses who it is.
- **Dance Off:** Whenever a key race is called, two partygoers have a 10-second dance battle.
