Ready to crank up the rivalry and turn your next party into an epic battleground? Whether you’re cheering for the Lions or rooting for the Aussies, nothing takes the tension (and fun) higher than a round of wild party drinking games. Welcome to the Drinking Dojo’s take on England vs Australia—where dares get cheeky, memes get spicy, and bragging rights are on the line.

## Why England vs Australia Makes for the Ultimate Drinking Game

From cricket showdowns to rugby feuds, the England vs Australia rivalry is legendary. It’s not just about sports—it’s about bragging, bold moves, and endless banter. So why not turn it into a viral drinking game? Whether you’re pregaming for the Ashes or just vibing with your mates, this is the party drinking game that brings everyone together (and might just split the room).

## What You Need

- A group of friends split into Team England and Team Australia  
- Your drink of choice (pints, cocktails, or whatever’s in the fridge)  
- Dare challenges or prompt cards (you can DIY or use Drinking Dojo’s [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com))  
- Meme drinking games packs (optional, but highly recommended for maximum banter)  
- A coin or dice for bonus rounds  

## How to Play: England vs Australia Drinking Game Rules

### 1. Split into Teams

Divide your crew into Team England and Team Australia. Get creative—break out the flags, face paint, or even your best attempt at accents.

### 2. Kick Off the Rounds

Each round, one team draws a challenge or meme card. It could be a classic dare, a meme-inspired drinking challenge, or a wild task that’ll get everyone laughing (or cringing).

#### Example Challenge Ideas:
- **Accent Attack:** Do your best impression of the opposing team’s accent. If your team laughs, everyone drinks.  
- **Sports Showdown:** Name as many legendary players from your country as you can in 20 seconds. Fail? Take two drinks.  
- **NSFW Dares:** (For after-dark parties only!) Lose a round, pick a dare from the NSFW pile.  

### 3. Bonus Rounds

Whenever a team scores three rounds in a row, the losers face a mega dare—think “sing your nation’s anthem” or “make a toast in the other team’s honor.” Or, throw in a viral twist: the losers must post a meme about their defeat in your group chat.

### 4. Keep Score, But Don’t Forget the Fun

Use a whiteboard, phone app, or just your memory to track wins. The team with the most points at the end claims ultimate bragging rights—until the next showdown.

## Extra Ideas to Level Up Your Game

- **Wedding party games:** Perfect for international couples or friends  
- **Couples drinking games:** Team up as England vs Australia pairs  
- **House party ideas:** Set up themed snacks (Tim Tams vs Jaffa Cakes, anyone?)  
- **Drinking challenges:** Try a “Fortnite drinking game” style sudden death round after every five rounds
