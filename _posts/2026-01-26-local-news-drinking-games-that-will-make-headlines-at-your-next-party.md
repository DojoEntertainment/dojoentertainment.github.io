If you thought local news was just for your parents’ morning routine, think again. It’s time to turn headlines into happy hour with the ultimate party drinking games inspired by the stories lighting up your city (or whatever’s trending on your feed). Whether you’re pregaming in Toronto, throwing a house party in Sydney, or vibing in Copenhagen, these drinking games will make even the slowest news day unforgettable.

## The Viral Newsroom: How to Play

You only need three things to get started:
- Your favorite drinks (beer, cider, cocktails, or whatever fuels your fun)
- A device with access to local news (TV, phone, or laptop)
- Friends who are ready to bend the rules and take on dare challenges

Here’s how to bring the newsroom to your living room:

### 1. **Breaking News Bingo**

**Setup:**  
Create a simple bingo card with classic local news tropes (think: “weather warning,” “awkward reporter sign-off,” “cat rescued from tree,” “politician dodges question”). You can use a custom drinking game builder like [Drinking Dojo’s tool](https://drinkingdojo.com) to make it extra spicy—or just scribble it down.

**Rules:**  
- Each player gets a bingo card.
- When something on your card happens during the broadcast, take a sip.
- Complete a row? Choose someone for a dare challenge from our meme drinking games pack.
- Blackout the board? Everyone else finishes their drink.

### 2. **Anchor’s Dare**

**Setup:**  
Pick a local news anchor as the game’s “star.” Every time your anchor says their catchphrase or does something meme-worthy (like an epic eye-roll), everyone drinks.

**Add NSFW dares** for late-night sessions or keep it tame for a wedding party game. If you’re feeling bold, toss in a few viral drinking games challenges for the losers.

### 3. **Scandal Sips**

**Setup:**  
When the news covers something wild—think viral Florida Man stories, surprise election day drinking game stories, or an unexpected wedding party crash—everyone must:
- Guess what happens next
- If you’re wrong, drink
- If you’re right, assign a dare to anyone

Make it competitive: whoever guesses the most headlines correctly by the end of the segment wins bragging rights (and maybe a round of fortnite drinking game next).

## House Party Ideas for News Junkies

Level up your local news drinking games with these bonus ideas:
- **Costume Challenge:** Dress as your favorite news anchor or meme-worthy local personality.
- **Couples Drinking Games:** Pair up and compete as “rival stations.” Losers do NSFW dares or host the next round.
- **Election Day Edition:** Play during major events. Every time a candidate dodges a question or a pollster gets it wrong, bottoms up!
