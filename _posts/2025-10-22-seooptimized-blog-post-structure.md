## Daylight Savings Drinking Games to Keep the Party Going All Night

Ready to turn those lost (or gained) hours into legendary memories? Daylight savings might mess with your sleep schedule, but at Drinking Dojo, we think it’s the perfect excuse for a party drinking game marathon. Whether you’re pregaming with friends or throwing a wild house party, these daylight savings-inspired drinking games and dare challenges will make that time shift unforgettable.

### Why Daylight Savings Is the Ultimate Excuse for Party Drinking Games

Twice a year, we all get a little more or a little less party time. Why not celebrate the time change with some viral drinking games, hilarious meme drinking games, and dare challenges that guarantee no one’s checking the clock?

### Daylight Savings Sips: The Ultimate Drinking Game

**What You Need:**
- Your favorite drinks  
- A group of friends (the more the merrier)  
- A phone or clock  
- Optional: Custom drinking game builder from [Drinking Dojo](https://drinkingdojo.com) for extra spice

**How to Play:**

1. **Spring Forward, Fall Back Shots**
   - Whenever the clock changes (2:00 AM to 3:00 AM or back to 2:00 AM), everyone takes a shot to “reset” their night.

2. **Time Warp Dare Challenges**
   - Every 15 minutes, the group draws a dare from a bowl or your favorite party pack.
   - For extra fun, grab some NSFW dares or meme drinking games for wild antics.
   - If anyone refuses a dare, they have to finish their drink.

3. **Lost Hour, Double Trouble**
   - If you “lose” an hour (spring forward), everyone has to do a drinking challenge—think “drink with your non-dominant hand” or “tell your most embarrassing party story.”
   - If you “gain” an hour (fall back), pair up for some couples drinking games. Last pair standing gets ultimate bragging rights.

4. **International Cheers**
   - Since daylight savings hits all over—US, UK, Canada, Australia, Denmark—shout out your city or country and toast whenever someone mentions a different region.

5. **Bonus: Custom Drinking Game Builder**
   - Want to spice things up? Use our [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) to create a daylight savings challenge tailored to your crew.

### Pro Tips for Daylight Savings Drinking Games

- **Hydrate:** Extra hour or not, water is your friend.
- **Pace Yourself:** The night is long, especially when the clocks jump around.
- **Get Creative:** Throw in some wedding party games or Fortnite drinking game challenges for even more chaos.
