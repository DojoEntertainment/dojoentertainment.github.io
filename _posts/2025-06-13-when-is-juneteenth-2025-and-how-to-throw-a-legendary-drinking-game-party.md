Ready for an epic summer bash? Juneteenth 2025 lands on **Thursday, June 19th**. If you’re looking for a reason to rally your crew, turn up the vibes, and try viral drinking games, this is your sign. Whether you’re in the US, UK, Canada, Australia, or Denmark, Juneteenth is the perfect moment to celebrate freedom, culture, and unforgettable memories—with a twist of wild party drinking games.

Let’s make this Juneteenth more than just another day off. Here’s your blueprint for a Juneteenth drinking game party that your squad will talk about all year.

## What Is Juneteenth and Why Celebrate With Drinking Games?

Juneteenth commemorates the end of slavery in the United States—a day for reflection, joy, and coming together. And what better way to bring people together than with legendary party drinking games, hilarious dare challenges, and meme-fueled fun? Whether you’re hosting a backyard barbecue, house party, or cozy apartment hangout, it’s time to raise a glass to freedom and friendship.

## The Ultimate Juneteenth Drinking Game

Want to spice up your Juneteenth? We’ve got you covered with a custom drinking game builder and viral drinking games inspired by the spirit of the holiday.

### What You’ll Need

- Your favorite drinks (cocktails, mocktails, beer—your call)
- A deck of cards or the [Drinking Dojo app](https://drinkingdojo.com) for meme drinking games and dare challenges
- Music playlist featuring Black artists and Juneteenth anthems
- Optional: red velvet cupcakes, BBQ snacks, and Juneteenth-themed decorations

## How to Play: Juneteenth House Party Drinking Game

**Set the vibe:**  
Create a playlist, decorate with red, green, and black, and invite your crew. This game works for 3–12 players.

### Game Rules

1. **Freedom Toast**  
   - Everyone grabs a drink.  
   - Go around the circle—each person shares something they’re grateful for or a fun historical fact about Juneteenth.  
   - After each toast or fact, everyone takes a sip.

2. **Truth or Dare Challenge**  
   - Use the custom dare challenges from Drinking Dojo or make your own.  
   - On your turn, pick “Truth” (answer a spicy question) or “Dare” (do a wild challenge). NSFW dares are fair game—if your crew is up for it!  
   - Refuse? Take two sips.

3. **Meme Drinking Game**  
   - Each player pulls a meme card (or uses a meme generator app).  
   - Whoever has the most relatable meme to the party or Juneteenth theme hands out three sips.

4. **Freedom Shout**  
   - When someone says “freedom,” everyone must raise their glass and shout “Cheers!”  
   - Last to do it takes a shot or finishes their drink.

### Winning the Game

There are no losers—just legendary memories. But if you want to crown a champ, whoever completes the most dares or shares the best fact wins bragging rights (and maybe a custom dare for next round).
