Ready to turn your next party into a wild challenge worthy of YouTube legend status? Enter the MrBeast drinking game: a viral drinking game inspired by the king of outrageous stunts, epic dares, and meme-worthy moments. Whether you're vibing with your uni flatmates in the UK, throwing a legendary house party in the US, or bringing the mayhem to an Aussie wedding, this party drinking game is guaranteed to make memories and spark laughter.

## What You Need

- A group of 3 or more (the more, the better!)
- Your favorite drinks (beer, seltzer, cocktails—you choose)
- A device for streaming MrBeast videos (laptop, TV, or phone)
- Dare cards or a custom dare list (bonus points for NSFW dares)
- Optional: Drinking Dojo’s [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) to up the stakes

## How To Play the MrBeast Drinking Game

1. **Pick Your Video**  
   Queue up a playlist of MrBeast's wildest videos—think big challenges, squad antics, and meme-filled chaos.

2. **Set Your Rules**  
   Before you start, agree on your party's drinking game rules. Here’s a base set to get you started:

   - **Every time Jimmy gives away money:** Take 1 sip
   - **Someone says “subscribe”:** Take 2 sips
   - **A crazy dare or challenge (staying in a circle, eating something weird):** Take 3 sips
   - **MrBeast shouts “CHANDLER” or “KARL”:** Everyone drinks
   - **A meme moment (someone gets pied, epic fail, etc.):** Dare challenge time! Draw a dare card and complete it—or finish your drink

3. **Dare Challenges**  
   Spice it up with dare challenges. When triggered, pull a card or use the Drinking Dojo custom game builder for on-the-spot dares. Mix in viral drinking games favorites, NSFW dares, or couple challenges for extra fun.

4. **Go Viral With Bonus Rounds**  
   At the end of each video, award “Beast Bucks” (use coins or points) for the wildest reaction, most creative dare, or best meme face. Winner can make up a new rule for the next round.

## Game Variations

- **Fortnite Drinking Game Crossover:** Watching a MrBeast gaming collab? Add Fortnite drinking game rules for double the chaos.
- **Wedding Party Games:** Got a wedding afterparty? Swap in dares for couples, or spice things up with drinking challenges fit for the newlyweds.
- **House Party Ideas:** Make it a tournament—last one standing wins a prize (or more drinks).
