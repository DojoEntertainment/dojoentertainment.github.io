## Why Make Your Brickyard 400 Party Legendary?

The Brickyard 400 isn’t just about speed and glory—it’s a prime opportunity for unforgettable party drinking games. With the roar of engines and the thrill of the race, every second is a chance for viral drinking games, daring challenges, and meme-worthy moments. No matter if you’re chilling in a dorm, lighting up a backyard barbecue, or hosting a wedding rager, these ideas will keep the good vibes rolling.

## Brickyard 400 Drinking Game Basics

**What you need:**
- Drinks (beer, seltzers, cocktails—whatever revs your engine)
- A TV or stream of the Brickyard 400
- Shot glasses or solo cups
- Dare cards or access to a [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com)
- Friends ready for wild dares and meme drinking games

## How to Play: Classic Rules

### **Lap Leader Sips**
- *Every time the race leader changes, everyone takes a sip.*

### **Yellow Flag Chug**
- *When a yellow flag comes out, everyone must finish their current drink.*

### **Pit Stop Dare Challenges**
- *Whenever your favorite driver heads to the pit, draw a dare from the pile. We recommend adding some NSFW dares or wild challenges to keep things spicy!*

### **Commentator Bingo**
- Make a bingo card with classic motorsport phrases (“trouble in turn three,” “tight race,” “photo finish”). Whenever you hear one, assign a drink or dare.

### **Crash Countdown**
- If there’s a crash, everyone has to pick a driver. The person whose driver is involved takes a double shot—or does a dare challenge!
