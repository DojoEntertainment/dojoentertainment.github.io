### Game Rules

1. **Draw and Drink:** Players take turns drawing a card from the deck. Each card has a unique challenge that players must complete.

2. **Card Challenges:**

    - **Hearts (Quick Draw):** The player must flip a coin. Heads means they're safe, tails means they take a drink.
  
    - **Diamonds (Whiskey River):** All players take a sip of their drink as a group toast to the "Whiskey River."
  
    - **Clubs (Horse Thief):** The player can "steal" a drink from another player, who then has to take a sip.
  
    - **Spades (Cowboy Showdown):** The player challenges another to a quick game of rock-paper-scissors. The loser drinks.

3. **Aces (Sheriff's Choice):** The player who draws an Ace becomes the "Sheriff" and can make any player take a drink or create a new rule for the round.

4. **Jokers (Campfire Story):** The player tells a quick cowboy story (real or imagined). The group votes on the best story. The winner assigns drinks.

### Winning the Game

The game continues until the deck is exhausted or players decide to stop. The player who drew the most Aces and became "Sheriff" the most times is crowned the ultimate cowboy.
