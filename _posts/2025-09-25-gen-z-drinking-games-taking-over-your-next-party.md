Gen Z knows how to turn any hangout into a full-blown event. It’s not just about sipping, it’s about making memories, laughing at wild dares, and sharing viral drinking games that end up on everyone’s story. Whether you’re hosting in a tiny dorm or decking out a bachelor pad, these party drinking games are exactly what you need to level up your next get-together.

## Why Gen Z Is Redefining Drinking Games

Forget your parents’ old beer pong routine. Gen Z wants games that are crazier, meme-ier, easier to share, and totally customizable. Think: drinking challenges inspired by TikTok trends, dare challenges that get spicy fast, and meme drinking games that have everyone cracking up.

## The Ultimate Gen Z Drinking Game Lineup

Ready to make your party unforgettable? Here are some of Gen Z’s favorite drinking games, with rules, how to play, and what you’ll need.

### 1. Meme Roulette

**What you need:**  
- Deck of meme cards (grab a meme pack from [Drinking Dojo](https://drinkingdojo.com) or print your own)  
- Drinks of choice

**How to play:**  
1. Shuffle the meme cards and stack them in the center.  
2. Each player draws a card on their turn and reads it out loud.  
3. If the meme perfectly fits someone at the table, the group votes. The person with the most votes drinks.  
4. If there’s a tie, both drink.

**Why it’s a hit:**  
You’ll be surprised how savage your friends get with their votes. Bonus: perfect for sharing on your socials.

### 2. Dare Challenge Mode

**What you need:**  
- Pre-made dare cards (go wild, go NSFW dares, or make your own with our [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com))  
- Drinks

**How to play:**  
1. Place the dare cards face down in a pile.  
2. Players take turns drawing a card and deciding: complete the dare or drink.  
3. If you refuse, you drink double.

**Why it’s a hit:**  
No one escapes unscathed. The dares get funnier (and wilder) as the night goes on.

### 3. Couples Drinking Games Twist

**What you need:**  
- A couple-friendly dare deck (or create one online)  
- Drinks

**How to play:**  
1. Pair up. Each couple takes turns drawing a card and answering questions or doing dares together.  
2. If they refuse a dare, both partners drink.

**Why it’s a hit:**  
Perfect for breaking the ice at double dates, wedding party games, or just spicing up a chill night in.

### 4. Fortnite Drinking Game

**What you need:**  
- Fortnite loaded up  
- Drink in hand

**How to play:**  
1. Set rules before the match. For example:  
   - Take a sip when you get eliminated.  
   - Chug if you win a round (Victory Royale!).  
   - Drink every time you build and it immediately gets destroyed.  
2. Last player standing picks someone to finish their drink.

**Why it’s a hit:**  
Gamers unite—this one’s for anyone who loves a little friendly competition (and maybe some light trolling).
