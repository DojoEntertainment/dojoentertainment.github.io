Ready to turn your next house party, pregame, or wild night in into an absolute legend? Meet Open—the drinking game where the only limit is your courage (and maybe your liver). From classic dare challenges to meme-worthy madness, Open is the ultimate way to break the ice, unleash NSFW dares, and keep everyone howling with laughter. Whether you’re vibing in a crowded dorm, taking over a wedding afterparty, or just want to spice up game night, this viral drinking game twist will make every round unforgettable.

## What Is Open?

Think of Open as the greatest hits of party drinking games, but with a twist. The game is all about honesty, guts, and, of course, glorious chaos. Players take turns answering wild questions or performing dare challenges—if you refuse, you drink. It’s simple, savage, and a guaranteed way to get everyone talking (and sipping).

## What You Need

- A group of thirsty legends (3+ players works best)
- Drinks of your choice (beer, cocktails, mocktails for the sober warriors)
- A stack of Open cards or your phone to use a [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com)  
- Optional: A playlist of viral meme songs and a few props for extra spice

## How To Play Open

1. **Sit in a Circle**  
   Old school, but it sets the vibe. Everyone grabs their drink.

2. **Deal or Generate Questions**  
   Use Open cards, the Drinking Dojo custom drinking game builder, or just shout out questions and dares.  
   Example prompts:
   - “Open your most embarrassing DM or drink.”
   - “Open up about your wildest party fail or finish your drink.”
   - “Show the last meme you saved or take a dare challenge.”

3. **Answer or Drink**  
   The player must answer honestly or complete the dare. If they skip, they drink. If you want to ramp up the chaos, let the group vote on whether the answer was juicy enough—if not, bottoms up!

4. **Spice It Up**  
   Add NSFW dares for the bold, wedding party games for the fancy, or meme drinking games for the TikTok crowd. Running out of ideas? The [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) has endless packs for every mood.
