title: Trumped Up Drinking Game
---


Welcome to the ultimate drinking game that takes inspiration from the one and only Donald Trump. Whether you love him or love to hate him, this game is sure to get the laughs flowing and the drinks pouring. Gather your friends, grab some drinks, and prepare for an evening of fun, laughter, and a little bit of friendly competition.

**What You Will Need**

- Your favorite beverages (alcoholic or non-alcoholic)
- A deck of cards
- A group of friends (the more, the merrier)
- A sense of humor

**How to Play**

1. **Setup**: Sit in a circle with your friends. Make sure everyone has their drink of choice handy. Shuffle the deck of cards and place it face down in the center of the circle.

2. **Card Draw**: Each player takes turns drawing a card from the deck. Each card has a specific action associated with it. Below are the rules for each card:

   - **Ace**: Everyone must shout "Make America Great Again" and take a sip.
   - **2**: Player who drew the card must pick someone to take two sips.
   - **3**: Everyone takes three sips. This is a classic group sip.
   - **4**: The player must talk like Trump for the next round. Use exaggerated hand gestures for bonus points.
   - **5**: Pick a political term. Everyone else must use that term in a sentence. The first person to mess up takes a sip.
   - **6**: The player must make a funny Trump quote. If no one laughs, they take a sip. If someone does laugh, they take a sip instead.
   - **7**: Call a fact or statistic about Trump. If anyone doubts it, the doubter takes a sip.
   - **8**: The player must make a hand gesture like Trump. The funniest one, as decided by the group, can assign a sip to someone.
   - **9**: Choose a category (like fast food, golf courses, etc.). Go around the circle until someone can’t think of a related item. That person takes a sip.
   - **10**: The player must imitate a news anchor reporting on Trump. Everyone votes on the best impression, and the winner can make someone else take two sips.
   - **J**: Jokester time! The player tells a joke about Trump. If the group finds it funny, they can assign a sip to anyone. If not, the joker takes a sip.
   - **Q**: The player must make a serious statement about politics. Everyone else must respond with an exaggeratedly silly response. The player who makes the most ridiculous response can assign a sip.
   - **K**: The player must pick a 'Trump card' from their own hand, which allows them to skip their next turn without drinking.

3. **Winning the Game**: There’s no real winner in this game, as the fun is in the experience. However, if you want to declare a 'champion', the player who can keep a straight face while playing the Trump impersonation round wins the title of "Ultimate Trumped Up Player."

**Tips for a Great Game**

- Make sure everyone is in good spirits and ready to have fun. The goal is to laugh and enjoy each other’s company.
- Keep the drinks flowing, but remember to drink responsibly. It's all about having a good time.
- Feel free to add your own rules or modify existing ones to suit your group’s sense of humor.

Get ready for an evening filled with laughter, ridiculous impressions, and plenty of sips. So gather your friends, pour those drinks, and let the games begin. Remember to keep it light-hearted and fun, and who knows, you might just discover your inner Trump!
