Looking for an epic way to spice up your next hangout? If you’re the type who can’t resist today’s Wordle (especially the October 8 Wordle answer), why not turn that daily puzzle into a viral drinking game everyone will want to try? Whether you’re chilling in a dorm, planning wild house party ideas, or getting ready for a wedding rager, combining the thrill of Wordle with drinking challenges is a guaranteed crowd-pleaser.

## What You’ll Need for This Drinking Game

- A device to play Wordle (phone, tablet, or laptop)
- Your favorite drinks (beer, cocktails, shots—dealer’s choice)
- A group of friends (2+ works best)
- Dare challenges or NSFW dares (optional, but seriously amps up the fun)

## How to Play the October 8 Wordle Answer Drinking Game

### Step 1: Set Up the Game

1. Gather everyone and open Wordle on your device.
2. Decide if you’ll play as one team or compete individually.
3. Pour everyone a drink to get started—because, obviously.

### Step 2: Make Your Guesses

- Each round, a player guesses a five-letter word.
- Rotate turns, or let everyone submit a word each guess if you’re in teams.

### Step 3: Take a Sip for Every Miss

- For every letter in your guess that’s not in the October 8 Wordle answer, take a sip.
- If your guess has a correct letter in the wrong spot, nominate a friend to take a sip instead.
- Guess the October 8 Wordle answer on the first try? Everyone else finishes their drink!

### Step 4: Dare Challenges for Extra Fun

Want to turn it into a viral drinking game? After every failed round, add a dare (think: meme drinking games or NSFW dares) from the [Drinking Dojo custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com). The unlucky guesser must complete the dare before the next round begins.

> **Dare ideas:**  
> - Do your best Fortnite dance  
> - Shout your favorite meme out the window  
> - Share an embarrassing story  
> - Try a couples drinking game mini-challenge

Get creative—these dares make for unforgettable drinking games and wild memories.
