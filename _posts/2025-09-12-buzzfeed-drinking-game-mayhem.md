Ready to take your next party drinking game to legendary status? If you’ve ever found yourself scrolling through Buzzfeed quizzes, listicles, or viral memes with your friends, it’s time to turn that internet obsession into the ultimate drinking challenge. Welcome to the Buzzfeed Drinking Game — where the rules are wild, the dares are epic, and the laughs are non-stop. Whether you’re looking to spice up your next house party or searching for fresh drinking challenges, this game has your back.

## What You Need

- Your drink of choice (cocktails, beers, or even mocktails for the brave)  
- A device to access Buzzfeed (phone, tablet, laptop, or smart TV)  
- A group of party-ready friends (2+ works, but the more, the wilder)  
- Dare cards or a custom drinking game builder (optional, but Drinking Dojo packs make it extra spicy!)  

## How To Play

### 1. Pick Your Buzzfeed Fuel

Decide as a group: Will you be doing quizzes, reading listicles, or watching Buzzfeed videos? You can mix it up or stick to your favorite format.

### 2. Set Up The Drinking Rules

Here are some classic rules to get the party started:

- **Quizzes:**  
    - If you get the most “basic” result, take two sips.  
    - If you and a friend get the same result, both take a drink.  
    - If the quiz predicts your favorite food or animal, everyone else drinks.  
    - Bonus dare: If you score a viral meme result, draw a dare from the NSFW dares pile!  

- **Listicles:**  
    - Every time someone says “That’s so me!” take a drink.  
    - If the listicle includes a reference to your country (US, UK, Canada, Australia, Denmark), everyone from that country drinks.  
    - If a meme makes the group laugh out loud, nominate someone to take a shot.  

- **Buzzfeed Videos:**  
    - Drink every time someone in the video tries a weird food or challenge.  
    - If a video features a celebrity you love, everyone drinks.  
    - If you spot a viral drinking game or meme drinking game, all players must attempt it or do a dare challenge!  

### 3. Add Dare Challenges

Crank up the fun by adding dare challenges between rounds. Use Drinking Dojo’s custom drinking game builder to create wild dares, or pull from our dare packs for NSFW dares and meme-inspired madness. Perfect for couples drinking games or those wild wedding party games.

### 4. Keep The Vibes Going
