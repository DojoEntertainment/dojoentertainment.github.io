## What You’ll Need for Your Fortnite Winterfest Party Drinking Games

## Fortnite Winterfest 2025 Party Drinking Game Rules

Ready to squad up? Here are the rules for the ultimate Fortnite Winterfest drinking game, perfect for everything from house parties to low-key hangouts.

### Basic Gameplay Rules for Fortnite Drinking Games

1. **Drop and Drink:**  
   - Every time your squad jumps from the Battle Bus, everyone takes a sip.
2. **Loot Luck:**  
   - Found a Legendary weapon? Make another player drink.
   - Got stuck with a Common? You drink twice.
3. **First Knockout:**  
   - The first person on your team to get eliminated in a round takes *two* drinks and must complete a dare from the Drinking Dojo Dare Deck.
4. **Victory Royale:**  
   - If your squad wins, everyone else (not on your team) takes three drinks each.

### Winterfest-Specific Challenges to Spice Up Your Party Drinking Games

Fortnite Winterfest is all about frosty fun and wild surprises. Add these viral drinking game rules for extra spice:

- **Snowball Fight:**  
  If you get knocked out by a snowball or festive weapon, finish your drink and post a meme about your epic fail in your group chat.
- **Holiday Outfits:**  
  Every time you spot someone in a holiday skin, shout “Happy Winterfest!” Last person to say it takes a drink.
- **Gift Grab:**  
  Whenever you open a Winterfest present in-game, assign a dare to any player of your choice.
