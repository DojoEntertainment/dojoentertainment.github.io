## How to Play

This drinking game is designed to be both educational and entertaining, incorporating historical facts about Dr Martin Luther King Jr and elements of classic drinking games. Here's how to play:

### Materials Needed

- A group of friends (preferably five or more)  
- Drinks of your choice (alcoholic or non-alcoholic)  
- A set of cards with Dr Martin Luther King Jr trivia questions  
- A timer  
- A comfortable space to gather  

### Game Rules

1. **The Setup**: Arrange players in a circle. Place the trivia cards in the center. Each player should have their drink within reach.

2. **Trivia Challenge**: The first player draws a card from the trivia deck and reads the question aloud. The player to their right has 30 seconds to answer. If they answer correctly, the reader drinks. If they answer incorrectly, they drink.

3. **Unity Cheers**: Every 15 minutes, pause the game for a "Unity Cheers". Each player shares a positive thought or fact about Dr Martin Luther King Jr. Everyone drinks together to celebrate unity and equality.

4. **Speech Imitation**: Every round, one player is randomly chosen to give a 30-second speech on a topic related to unity or friendship. Creativity and humor are encouraged. After their speech, all other players vote on how inspiring it was. If the majority finds it inspiring, the speaker chooses someone to drink. If not, they take a drink themselves.

5. **Dream Round**: At any point, a player can announce a "Dream Round". During this round, each player shares a personal dream or goal. This is a non-drinking round meant to inspire and connect the group.

6. **Most Likely To**: Incorporate the classic [Most Likely To](https://drinkingdojo.com/games/most-likely-to) game. Each player writes down a "Most Likely To" scenario related to Dr King's values or achievements. Players vote on who in the group fits the scenario best. The person with the most votes drinks.

### Ending the Game

The game continues until the trivia cards are exhausted, or players decide to conclude. End with a final "Unity Cheers" and a moment of reflection on Dr Martin Luther King Jr's legacy.
