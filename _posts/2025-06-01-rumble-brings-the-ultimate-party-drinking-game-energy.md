There’s a new contender in the arena of party drinking games, and it’s got everyone buzzing: Rumble. If you’re ready to throw down, raise your glasses, and bring absolute chaos to your next house party, this is the drinking game you need to try. Whether you’re in a London flat, an Aussie beach house, or a Danish dorm, Rumble is all about wild dares, meme-worthy challenges, and unforgettable memories with your crew.

## What Is Rumble?

Rumble is a free-for-all drinking game where quick thinking, gutsy dares, and hilarious meme drinking games collide. Think of it as the ultimate mashup between classic dare challenges and viral drinking games—ramped up with Drinking Dojo’s signature flair. It’s perfect for everything from pregame shenanigans to wedding party games, or just spicing up a low-key night in.

## What You Need to Play

- A group of 4+ friends (the more, the wilder)
- Your favorite drinks (beer, cocktails, or mocktails—your call)
- A deck of Rumble cards (DIY with paper, or use the [Drinking Dojo custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) to make it epic)
- Table or floor space for everyone to gather

## How to Set Up Rumble

1. **Set the Mood:** Pick a vibe—chill or full-on party animal.
2. **Deal the Cards:** Shuffle the Rumble deck and place it face-down in the center.
3. **Pour Your Drinks:** Everyone should have a full glass ready for action.

## Rumble Rules

1. **Draw and Decide:** Players take turns drawing a card. Each card has a dare, challenge, or meme-inspired task. 
2. **Do or Drink:** If you complete the dare, you stay safe. Chicken out, and you drink.
3. **Rumble Round:** Every fifth card is a “Rumble” card—this means everyone has to compete at once. Last to finish the challenge (or fails the dare) takes a double drink.
4. **NSFW Twist:** Want to spice things up? Mix in some NSFW dares (perfect for couples drinking games or bold house party ideas). Make sure everyone’s cool with it!
5. **Custom Chaos:** Use the custom drinking game builder to add in Fortnite drinking game tasks, inauguration day drinking game themes, or even wedding party games for that extra twist.

## Sample Rumble Dares

- **Meme Madness:** Recreate the last viral meme you saw—if no one gets it, drink twice.
- **Election Day Debate:** Start a 30-second debate on the best party drink—loser drinks.
- **Fortnite Drop:** Do your best Fortnite dance; the worst one drinks.
- **Wedding Toast:** Give a fake wedding toast to someone in the group (bonus points for cringey stories).

## Why Rumble Rules the Party
