At Drinking Dojo, we’re all about taking your house party ideas up a notch—and what better way than with viral drinking games inspired by pop’s biggest icon?

Whether you’re pregaming for a concert, vibing with friends, or planning unforgettable wedding party games, these Taylor Swift Reputation party drinking games will have you singing, sipping, and maybe oversharing just a little. Ready for it?

## What You’ll Need for Your Reputation Drinking Game

- **Taylor Swift’s Reputation album** (Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube—your call)  
- Your drink of choice (mocktails count!)  
- Shot glasses or cups  
- A group of friends (2+ is perfect)  
- Dare challenges printed out or on your phone  
- Optional: Drinking Dojo’s [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) for added spice  

## Reputation Drinking Game Rules and Gameplay

Put the album on shuffle, fill up those glasses, and let the good times roll. Here’s how to play:

### Basic Gameplay Steps

1. **Pick Your Track**  
   Start the *Reputation* album. Every new song brings a new round.  

2. **Take a Sip When…**  
   - Taylor mentions snakes, kings, or reputations  
   - There’s a dramatic beat drop  
   - She calls out her old self  
   - Lyrics get a little savage  

3. **Finish Your Drink If…**  
   - Anyone can rap the *entire* verse in “End Game” without messing up  
   - Someone stands up and does their best “Look What You Made Me Do” dance  

4. **Dare Challenges to Amp Up the Fun**  
   - At the start of each song, draw a dare challenge. These can be classic dares, NSFW dares (if your crowd is up for it), or meme drinking games inspired by Taylor’s iconic moments. Example dares:  
     - Text your ex “Ready For It?”  
     - Give your best evil Taylor impression  
     - Share your messiest breakup story (drink if it’s too wild)  

5. **Party Power-Ups with Custom Drinking Game Builder**
