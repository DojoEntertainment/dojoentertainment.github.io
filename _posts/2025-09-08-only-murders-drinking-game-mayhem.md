Ready to crack the case, test your detective skills, and maybe embarrass yourself with some NSFW dares? Let’s dive into how to play Only Murders, Drinking Dojo style.

## What You’ll Need for Your Next Party Drinking Game

- **A group of 4–10 players** (the more, the merrier)
- **Deck of playing cards** or Drinking Dojo’s [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com)  
- **Plenty of your favorite drinks**
- **Dare cards or a list of dares** (bonus points for meme drinking games dares)
- **A sense of humor and zero shame**

## How To Play Only Murders – The Viral Drinking Game

### Set Up Your Game Roles

1. **Assign Roles**
   - Shuffle your deck and deal one card to each player.  
   - One card is the “Murderer” (ace of spades), one is the “Detective” (king), the rest are “Innocents.”
   - Keep roles secret!

2. **The First Toast**
   - Everyone raises a glass. The Murderer winks at someone to “kill” them, but only the two know what just happened.

3. **The Mystery Begins**
   - When a player is winked at, they must dramatically “die” (make it as hilarious as possible), then take a big sip.
   - The Detective’s job is to watch for shady eye contact and guess who the Murderer is.

### Game Flow for an Unforgettable Drinking Challenge

- **Each round** begins with a toast and casual conversation—no one knows who’s who yet!
- **If you’re murdered**:  
  - Dramatically “die” and finish your drink.
  - Draw a dare card or take on a drinking challenge—think NSFW dares, meme drinking games, or anything wild from our custom builder.
- **Detective’s Guess**:  
  - At any time, the Detective can accuse someone.  
  - If correct: Murderer drinks, plus a group dare.  
  - If wrong: Detective drinks and does a dare challenge.

### Win Conditions in This Party Drinking Game

- If the Murderer “kills” everyone without being caught, they win and assign dares to all remaining players.
- If the Detective catches them, the Murderer must complete a super dare (think viral drinking games level) and take two drinks.
