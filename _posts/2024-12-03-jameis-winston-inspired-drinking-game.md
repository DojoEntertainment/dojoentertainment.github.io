---


Welcome to the ultimate football-themed drinking game inspired by none other than Jameis Winston. Whether you are a die-hard fan of his on-field antics or just love a good time with friends, this game will surely keep the party going. So grab your favorite drinks, gather your friends, and get ready to dive into the Jameis Winston Drinking Game.

## How to Play

The Jameis Winston Drinking Game is as exciting as his unpredictable plays on the field. The game is best enjoyed with a group of friends during a live Jameis Winston game. However, if there is no game on the schedule, you can always binge-watch game highlights.

### Materials Needed

- A TV or device to watch the game
- Your favorite drinks
- A group of friends ready to have fun
- Snacks (optional but recommended)

### Basic Rules

1. **Touchdown Celebration**  
   Every time Jameis Winston throws a touchdown, everyone takes a celebratory sip. If the touchdown is over 40 yards, finish your drink.

2. **Interception Alert**  
   If Winston throws an interception, take a penalty shot. If he throws two back-to-back interceptions, do a double shot. Ouch - but those are the rules.

3. **Rushing Yards**  
   When Winston rushes for more than 10 yards on a single play, take two sips. If he rushes for more than 20 yards, chug for five seconds.

4. **Fumble Fiasco**  
   If Winston fumbles the ball, take a sip of your drink. If the opposing team recovers, take two sips.

5. **Unique Celebration**  
   If Jameis does one of his unique celebrations, the last person to mimic it takes a shot.

6. **Game Winning Drive**  
   If Jameis leads a game-winning drive, everyone raises their glass for a toast and finishes their drink.

### Bonus Rule

- **Commentator Mention**  
  Each time the commentators mention Winston's college days or past controversies, everyone takes a sip.

## Tips for Enjoying the Game

- **Stay Hydrated**  
  Make sure to have water available to keep hydrated, especially if you are playing over multiple games or watching a long highlight reel.

- **Snack Attack**  
  Keep snacks handy. Football and munchies go hand-in-hand, and they will help balance the alcohol.

- **Know Your Limits**  
  Always drink responsibly and know your limits. The game is about fun and camaraderie, not overindulgence.
