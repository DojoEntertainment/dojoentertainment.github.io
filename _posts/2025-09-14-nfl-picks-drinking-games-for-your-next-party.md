### What You’ll Need

- Your favorite drinks (beer, seltzers, cocktails—dealer’s choice)
- A TV, laptop, or phone to stream the NFL game
- NFL picks sheet (print one or keep it on your phone)
- Drinking Dojo dare challenges or our [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) for extra spice
- Optional: Meme cards, NSFW dares, or fun props for bonus rounds

### How To Play: NFL Picks Drinking Game

#### 1. **Make Your Picks**
Before kickoff, everyone picks the winners for each game quarter, final score predictions, or even wild stats (first touchdown scorer, next penalty, total yards, you name it). Write them down or plug them into a shared doc.

#### 2. **Set Up The Drinking Rules**

Mix and match these rules to fit your vibe:

- **Wrong Pick, Take a Sip**  
  Every time your pick loses a quarter, you drink.
- **Wildcard Drinking Challenge**  
  Miss a prediction? Spin the Dare Wheel (or use a Drinking Dojo challenge card) and complete a viral drinking game dare.
- **Double Down**  
  Feeling risky? Double your drink if you want to change your pick at halftime.
- **Meme Mayhem**  
  Every time a meme-worthy moment happens (think wild fumble or hilarious touchdown dance), everyone votes on the best meme caption—the winner assigns a drink to anyone!

#### 3. **Bonus Dares For Extra Fun**
Spice things up with themed challenges between quarters:
- **NSFW dares** for the brave
- **Fortnite drinking game** mini-rounds during commercial breaks
- **Wedding party games** for couples in the crew
- *Election day drinking game or inauguration day drinking game* dares if you’re feeling political (bonus round!)
