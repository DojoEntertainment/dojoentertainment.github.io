Sometimes, the universe gives you a free pass—like when school gets canceled and suddenly your crew has an unexpected day or night to party. Whether it’s snow, strikes, or just wild luck, why not turn the bonus time into an unforgettable hangout? Enter the world of school cancellations drinking games: the ultimate excuse to gather your mates, crack open your favorite drinks, and let the mayhem begin.

Forget boring reruns or scrolling TikTok for hours. Here’s how to turn a canceled day into a legendary party using the best party drinking games, dare challenges, and a sprinkle of meme magic.

## Essential Drinking Games for School Cancellations

When plans get thrown out the window, all you need are some friends, drinks, and a killer game. Here are a few viral drinking games and meme drinking games perfect for those unexpected home days:

### 1. **Cancellations Chaos**

**Materials Needed:**
- Drinks of choice (beer, seltzers, cocktails, whatever suits your fancy)
- A deck of cards
- Sticky notes or paper scraps
- Pens

**Setup:**
- Write classic school events (e.g., “Quiz,” “Assembly,” “Field Trip,” “PE Class”) on sticky notes.
- Mix them up in a bowl.

**How to Play:**
- Each player draws a note and reads it aloud.
- The group makes up a quick rule based on that event. For example:
  - “Quiz”: Ask a trivia question. Wrong answer? Drink!
  - “PE Class”: Everyone does five jumping jacks. Last to finish drinks.
  - “Field Trip”: Everyone switches seats. Last one to sit drinks.
- After every round, draw a new event and keep the madness going.

**Why it rocks:**  
It’s totally customizable, and you can keep adding new school-themed dares as the night goes on.

### 2. **Meme Teacher**

**Materials Needed:**
- Drinks
- Phones with meme apps or Google
- A timer

**How to Play:**
- The “teacher” gives a theme (like “math class meltdown” or “awkward prom moments”).
- Everyone has 60 seconds to find or create the funniest meme.
- The teacher picks the winner, who assigns drinks to others.
- Losers must perform an NSFW dare (if you’re feeling bold).

**Pro tip:**  
Use the [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) from Drinking Dojo to add your own meme themes and dares for endless replay value.

### 3. **Snow Day Dare Challenges**

Perfect for those classic snowed-in cancellations (or just pretending you’re in a winter wonderland).

**Materials Needed:**
- Drinks
- Dare cards (make your own or use an online generator)
- A hat or bowl

**How to Play:**
- Pass the hat around. Each player pulls a dare and decides to complete it or drink.
- Include a mix of fun, embarrassing, and party-starting dares. Need inspo? Drinking Dojo’s viral drinking games packs are loaded with ideas.

## Pro Tips to Level Up Your Party Drinking Games

- **Mix in themed events:** Try an inauguration day drinking game or a Fortnite drinking game for extra laughs.
- **Keep it safe:** Pace yourselves, know your limits, and have some water and snacks on hand.
- **Couples or group:** These drinking challenges work whether you’re vibing with your partner or throwing a full-on house party.
- **Add wild NSFW dares:** If your crew is up for it, spice up the night with some not-safe-for-classroom antics.
