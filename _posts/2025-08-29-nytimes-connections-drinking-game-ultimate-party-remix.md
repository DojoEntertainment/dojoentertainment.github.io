Ready to take your game night to the next level? If you’ve ever raged over a tricky round of Connections and thought, “This would be better with drinks,” we’ve got the party drinking game remix for you. Welcome to the ultimate NyTimes Connections drinking game—where your word skills are put to the test, and every guess could end in a dare, a laugh, or a legendary drinking challenge.

### What’s the NyTimes Connections Drinking Game?

Picture this: your crew huddled around, trying to spot word connections while the stakes get higher (and the glasses get emptier). This viral drinking game is perfect for anyone who wants to blend brainpower with buzz, making it one of the most unforgettable house party ideas around. Whether you’re pregaming, chilling in your dorm, or throwing a destination wedding afterparty, this is your new go-to.

### What You’ll Need

- **A way to play Connections** (phone, tablet, or printouts)
- **Drinks of your choice** (cocktails, beer, or non-alcoholic—no judgment)
- **Dare cards or access to our [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) for meme drinking games and NSFW dares**
- **Your favorite party people** (2+ players)

### How to Play

#### 1. Set Up the Game

- Everyone gathers ‘round with their drinks.
- Launch the Connections puzzle on your device or print it out for the group.
- Decide the order of play (rock-paper-scissors, anyone?).

#### 2. The Rules

- **Team Up or Go Solo:** Play as individuals or small teams.
- **Guess a Connection:** On your turn, suggest a group of four words you think are connected.
- **Nail It?** If you’re right, you hand out drinks—give out one drink to a player of your choice.
- **Miss It?** If you’re wrong, you drink. Plus, pull a dare card or use our [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) for a wild dare challenge.
- **Meme Mayhem:** If your group can’t stop laughing at a particularly bad guess, the person who made it must share their best meme impression before taking a drink.
- **Final Connection:** If someone completes the last group, everyone else drinks. If it’s a wedding party game, the couple gets to make a rule for the next round.

#### 3. Bonus Rules for Extra Chaos

- **Speed Round:** Set a timer. If you don’t guess in 30 seconds, drink and pull a dare.
- **NSFW Dares:** Sneak in some extra spice by using our NSFW dare challenges for wrong answers (perfect for couples drinking games or wild house parties).
- **Theme Nights:** Try a Fortnite drinking game or even an inauguration day drinking game twist by swapping in themed dares or words.
