---


As autumn leaves blanket the earth in vibrant hues, November ushers in National Native American Heritage Month. This time of year is perfect for gathering friends and family to celebrate the rich histories and cultures of Native American tribes. If you're looking for a unique way to honor this month, why not try a fun and engaging drinking game inspired by Native American heritage? This game is designed to foster learning, laughter, and camaraderie.

## Materials Needed

- A deck of thematic cards with Native American facts and trivia
- Beverages of your choice
- A cozy space for gathering
- Optional: Snacks inspired by Native American cuisine such as corn chips, pumpkin seeds, or fry bread

## Game Setup

1. **Create or Purchase a Deck of Cards**: Each card should feature a fact or trivia about Native American history, culture, notable figures, or significant events. This could include information about different tribes, traditional practices, or famous Native American individuals.
   
2. **Designate a Game Master**: Choose someone who will read the cards and manage the flow of the game. This person can also play, but they will ensure that everyone understands the rules.

## How to Play

### 1. Gather and Settle In

Invite your friends and family to sit in a circle. Make sure everyone has their beverage of choice and snacks are easily accessible.

### 2. Draw a Card

The Game Master draws a card from the deck and reads it aloud. The card might contain a piece of trivia, a question, or a fun fact.

### 3. Answer or Drink

- **Trivia**: If the card contains trivia, the first person to answer correctly gets to choose someone to take a sip of their drink. If no one knows the answer, everyone takes a sip, and the Game Master shares the correct answer.
  
- **Questions**: If the card contains a question about opinions or personal experiences related to Native American culture, everyone shares their thoughts. The most insightful or amusing answer, as judged by the group, earns the person who shared it the right to choose someone to drink.

### 4. Special Cards

Include special cards in the deck to keep the game dynamic

- **Story Time**: The person who draws this card shares a story or fact they know about Native American culture. Everyone else takes a sip while they listen.

- **Challenge**: The card might contain a challenge related to Native American traditions like attempting to say a word in a Native American language. Success means choosing someone else to drink; failure means taking a sip yourself.

### 5. Continue the Celebration

The game continues with each person drawing a card in turn. The aim is to have fun, learn, and celebrate the heritage and contributions of Native American communities.

## Conclusion

This drinking game is not just about having fun but also about appreciating and honoring the diverse cultures and histories of Native American tribes. By integrating educational elements into the game, you ensure that the spirit of National Native American Heritage Month is respected and celebrated.
