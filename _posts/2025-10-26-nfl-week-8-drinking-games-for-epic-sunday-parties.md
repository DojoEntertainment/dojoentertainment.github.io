Ready to turn your NFL Week 8 watch party into a legendary event? Whether you’re rooting for your fantasy team, trash-talking with mates, or just vibing with snacks and drinks, there’s no better way to amp up the energy than with some wild party drinking games. Drinking Dojo has the dares, meme magic, and custom drinking game builder you need to make those touchdowns and turnovers unforgettable.

## Materials You’ll Need

- Drinks of your choice (beer, seltzer, cocktails, or non-alcoholic for the designated driver)  
- Shot glasses and/or pints  
- Printed or digital rules (save this post!)  
- A TV or streaming device for the game  
- Friends who love a bit of friendly chaos  

## Game 1: Touchdown Toast

This classic drinking game is perfect for NFL Week 8—it’s easy, meme-worthy, and gets everyone in on the action.

**How to Play:**  
- **Every touchdown:** Everyone raises their glass and takes a big sip.  
- **Missed field goal:** Last person to cheer takes a dare (get creative or use a pack from Drinking Dojo).  
- **Turnover:** Group votes on the best meme reaction; the winner hands out two drinks, the loser takes two.  
- **Overtime:** Everyone finishes their drink (or grabs a new one to keep the energy alive).  

## Game 2: The Custom Dare Challenge

Want to spice things up? Use Drinking Dojo’s [custom drinking game builder](https://drinkingdojo.com) to create NFL-themed dare challenges on the fly.

**How to Play:**  
- Before kickoff, each friend adds three dares to a “challenge bowl” (think: “Do your best touchdown dance,” “Speak only in football puns for a quarter,” “Text your ex your game predictions”).  
- Each quarter, draw dares after every big play (interceptions, 20+ yard gains, sacks).  
- Complete the dare or take a drink—your call!  

## Game 3: Couples Drinking Games for the Halftime Show

If you’re watching with your partner, halftime is the perfect time to swap out classic drinking challenges for something a bit more flirty (or NSFW, if that’s your vibe).

**How to Play:**  
- List out quick-fire questions about your favorite teams or players.  
- Wrong answer? Take a sip and accept a dare from your partner.  
- Right answer? Give out a drink or request a halftime dance.  

## Game 4: Super Meme Drinking

NFL memes are half the reason to watch the game, right? This viral drinking game keeps the laughs coming.

**How to Play:**  
- Anytime the announcers mention “momentum swing,” “underdog,” or “revenge game,” everyone makes up a meme caption on the spot. The funniest one gives out a drink.  
- If a meme-worthy moment happens on-screen (awkward fan, wild reaction, failed celebration), the group votes on the best meme. Winner picks who drinks.  

## Bonus: Fortnite Drinking Game Mash-Up

Got gamers in the crew? During commercial breaks or after the game, fire up the Fortnite drinking game for a second round of mayhem. Loser of each round takes on a dare or drinks—your party, your rules.

NFL Week 8 is the perfect excuse to break out the best drinking games, dare challenges, and meme magic. Whether you’re at a house party, chilling in a dorm, or throwing a wedding afterparty, Drinking Dojo has you covered with all the tools and custom packs you need to make your night unforgettable.
