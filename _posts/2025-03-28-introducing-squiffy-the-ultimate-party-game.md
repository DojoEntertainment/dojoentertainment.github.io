## What is Squiffy?

Squiffy is a fast, fun, and chaotic drinking game made for real-world connection. Whether you’re on a first date, hosting a flat party, or vibing with your besties, Squiffy brings people together with juicy questions, hilarious dares, and total unpredictability.

## How to Play

1. **Gather your crew** (and maybe a few drinks 🍻).  
2. **Add everyone to the game.** The more, the messier.  
3. **Start the game.** One person reads the cards out loud each round.  
4. **Follow the prompts.** You’ll get a mix of truths, dares, questions, and mini challenges.  
5. **Keep going.** There’s no official end—play until the chaos subsides (or everyone’s too giggly to continue).  

🎯 The vibe? Silly, spicy, and social.  
💡 The goal? Laugh, connect, and create some unforgettable memories.  
🚨 The only rule? Drink responsibly and know your limits.

You can find the full rules [here](/articles/squiffy).
